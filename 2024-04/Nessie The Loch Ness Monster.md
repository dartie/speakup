# Nessie: The Loch Ness Monster   [A2]

Se questa creatura solitaria e affascinante esistesse davvero, sarebbe la più misteriosa e anche la più longeva, visto che la sua leggenda risale alla cristianizzazione delle Highlands. Ancora oggi c’è chi la cerca...

The Loch Ness monster is a mysterious creature said to live in the deep, dark waters of Loch Ness. ‘Loch’ is the Scottish word for ‘lake’. Situated in the Highlands of Scotland, near the city of Inverness, Loch Ness is the second-largest lake in Scotland, after Loch Lomond. Its deepest point is 230 metres deep, and it is the lake with the greatest volume of water in the UK. This makes it the ideal hiding place for an aquatic monster!

## WHAT ‘NESSIE’ LOOKS LIKE
The Loch Ness monster is also affectionately known by its [nickname](## "soprannome"), Nessie. Some individuals who [claim](## "affermare") to have [spotted](## "avvistare") the creature describe it as having four [limbs](## "arti") and a large round body. Others suggest it has a long, thin body and [neck](## "collo"), similar to a snake, with [humps](## "gobbe")[protruding](## "sporgere") from the water. However, there is a general consensus that the monster is a [greenish](## "verdastro") colour.

## THE LEGEND
The first [reported](## "segnalare") [sighting](## "avvistamento") of the Loch Ness monster is credited to an Irish [monk](## "monaco"), St. Columba. He [reported](## "segnalare")ly encountered a ferocious beast on the [banks](## "rive") of Loch Ness in 565 [AD](## "dopo Cristo (anno Domini)")[while on his way to](## "mentre si recava a") visit Brude, the king of the Picts, at Brude’s castle near Inverness. There, Columba [learned](## "venire a sapere") about a water beast that had killed a man, so he [banished](## "scacciare, allontanare") the monster to the depths of the lake.

## THE SIGHTINGS
A well-known [alleged](## "presunto, ipotetico") [sighting](## "avvistamento") occurred in 1933 when a London couple, George Spicer and his wife, encountered a strange creature crossing the road in front of them while driving to Inverness. The following year, a man named Arthur Grant [claim](## "affermare")ed to have nearly hit an unknown beast while riding his motorcycle in the area at night. Around the same time, a doctor took a famous photo of a dinosaur-like creature in the loch but this was later revealed to be a [hoax](## "burla").

## FACT OR FICTION?
Since then, many people have taken pictures and made videos of the creature, although the images are consistently [blurry](## "sfuocate"). The lake has been carefully explored with submarines and special equipment, including sonar systems, microphones and underwater cameras. Aerial images and DNA samples have also been taken, yet nothing has been found. Most people believe that Nessie is a fictional creature and likely just a giant bird, [otter](## "lontra"), or large [eel](## "anguilla"). [Despite this](## "ciò nonostante"), seven new [sighting](## "avvistamento")s are [reported](## "segnalare") every year. Since the rumours began, there have been over a thousand [sighting](## "avvistamento")s, and approximately one million people visit the loch each year in the hope of spotting the mythical creature.
