<p>Historically, the <a href="##" title="consiglio">advice</a> given to people who are <a href="##" title="sovrappeso">overweight</a> or obese has been simple: eat less and move more. However, this hasn’t worked for many people. Now there’s another solution: weight-loss <a href="##" title="farmaci">drugs</a>, specifically semaglutide, which is sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy. These injectable <a href="##" title="farmaci con prescrizione medica">prescription medications</a> have exploded in popularity in recent years.</p>

<h2 id="not-for-weight-loss">NOT FOR WEIGHT LOSS</h2>

<p>In the US, an estimated one in three adults is <a href="##" title="sovrappeso">overweight</a>, with more than two in five considered obese. Millions of people want to lose body fat. This has resulted in a multi-billion-dollar weight-loss industry which has promoted <a href="##" title="innumerevoli">countless</a> miracle diets and life-changing products for decades. </p>

<h2 id="influencers">INFLUENCERS </h2>

<p>In recent years, the industry has experienced a <a href="##" title="incremento, aumento">boost</a> as celebrities and influencers are promoting Ozempic as an effective way to lose weight. First sold in the US in 2018, Ozempic is approved there to help lower the risk of cardiovascular problems in adults with type 2 diabetes. However, Wegovy is also approved for weight loss, and many doctors also illegally prescribe Ozempic to <a href="##" title="sovrappeso">overweight</a> patients.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">HOW IT WORKS</h2>

<p>Ozempic helps people lose weight by acting as an appetite <a href="##" title="inibitore">suppressant</a>. It <a href="##" title="imitare">mimics</a> a hormone called GLP-1 and sends signals to the brain to reduce <a href="##" title="fame">hunge</a>r and evoke a feeling of <a href="##" title="sazietà">fullness</a>. The drug also slows digestion by increasing the time it takes for food to leave the body. </p>

<h2 id="side-effects">SIDE EFFECTS </h2>

<p>The drug has many side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain and constipation. It can also result in what has become known online as ‘Ozempic face’ and ‘Ozempic <a href="##" title="culo">butt</a>‘: <a href="##" title="scavate, svuotate">hollow</a><a href="##" title="guance">cheeks</a> or <a href="##" title="cadente">saggy</a> skin in these and other parts of the body from losing fat too quickly. </p>

<h2 id="no-drug-for-diabetics">NO DRUG FOR DIABETICS</h2>

<p>Over the past five years, the number of Americans taking Ozempic and other semaglutide medications has <a href="##" title="aumentato di quaranta volte">increased forty-fold</a>. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that by 2031, fifteen million adults in the US will be taking these <a href="##" title="farmaci">drugs</a> for weight loss. This does not include those taking them for diabetes; the <a href="##" title="generalizzato">widespread</a> use of Ozempic has resulted in <a href="##" title="carenza">shortages</a> of the drug, with diabetics, for whom it was created, having trouble obtaining it. Although many countries have <a href="##" title="vietare">banned</a> or restricted the use of Ozempic for weight loss, Reuters reports that people with enough money can still buy and <a href="##" title="accumulare">stockpile</a> it.</p>

<h2 id="counterfeits">COUNTERFEITS</h2>

<p>The demand for Ozempic has also resulted in dangerous <a href="##" title="contraffazioni">counterfeits</a> of the drug being sold on the American and European markets, resulting in several hospitalisations. In December 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration <a href="##" title="confiscare">seized</a> thousands of units of counterfeit Ozempic injections and advised pharmacists and customers <a href="##" title="essere prudenti">to exercise caution</a> when buying the medicine.  </p>
