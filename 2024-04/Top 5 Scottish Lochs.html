<p>Every loch is special in its own way. Some are remote and wild places that cannot be reached by car, others are legendary tourist locations. Here are five of the best lochs to explore:</p>

<h2 id="1-loch-ness">1. LOCH NESS</h2>

<p>Legendary in every sense, Loch Ness contains 7,452 million cubic metres of water, more than all the lakes in England and Wales put together. It lies south of Inverness on the Great Glen, a geological <a href="##" title="faglia">fault line</a> visible from outer space. Tourists come to Loch Ness to enjoy boat trips, to fish, <a href="##" title="individuare, scoprire">spot</a> wildlife and photograph the ruins of Urquhart Castle. Many hope <a href="##" title="avvistare, intravedere">to catch a glimpse</a> of the loch’s most elusive inhabitant: Nessie, the Loch Ness monster, first photographed in 1933. There have been many <a href="##" title="avvistamenti">sightings</a> since, but no scientific evidence that the monster exists. The only place you are guaranteed to see the monster is in an exhibition at the Loch Ness Centre.</p>

<h2 id="2-loch-lomond">2. LOCH LOMOND</h2>

<p>Located on the west coast, close to Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow, Loch Lomond acts as a <a href="##" title="entrata">gateway</a> to the Highlands. Scotland’s largest loch by surface area, at 71 square kilometres, it is the <a href="##" title="punto focale, centro dell’attenzione">focal point</a> of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park. The loch is surrounded by <a href="##" title="bosco">woodland</a> and <a href="##" title="sentieri">trails</a>, and <a href="##" title="sovrastato da">overlooked by</a> Ben Lomond mountain. Popular for tourist boats and day cruises, there are thirty islands here to explore, many with links to famous historical figures and modern celebrities. Inchconnachan, an island in Loch Lomand uninhabited by humans, <a href="##" title="vantarsi di">boasts</a> its own colony of wallabies!</p>

<h2 id="3-loch-awe">3. LOCH AWE</h2>

<p>Located near Oban, on Scotland’s west coast, Loch Awe is the longest inland Scottish loch. It has a surface area of 38.5 square kilometres and is surrounded by one-thousand-metre mountain peaks and <a href="##" title="verdeggiante, lussureggiante">verdant green</a> landscape, sandy and <a href="##" title="spiagge rocciose">rocky beaches</a>, forest <a href="##" title="sentieri">trails</a> and <a href="##" title="cascate">waterfalls</a>. At its northern end lies the romantic 15th-century ruin of Kilchurn Castle, once home to the powerful Campbell clan. While a quiet road follows its <a href="##" title="sponda occidentale">western shore</a> towards the coast, the <a href="##" title="paesaggio">scenery</a> of the northern half of the loch is <a href="##" title="maestoso">awe-inspiring</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-loch-morar">4. LOCH MORAR</h2>

<p>Located close to Mallaig and the pristine beaches of Scotland’s west coast, Loch Morar feels <a href="##" title="ben lontano">far-removed</a> from civilisation. It is Scotland’s deepest freshwater loch at 310 metres: you could <a href="##" title="affondare">sink</a> the Eiffel Tower here and not see its top! What you might see, if you have a fertile imagination, is Morag, the mythical lake monster said to inhabit its depths. The serene waters of Loch Morar are ideal for kayaking. With the land <a href="##" title="svuotare">emptied</a> of families during the notorious <a href="##" title="liberazione delle Highland">Highland Clearances</a>, this remains a <a href="##" title="inquietante, suggestivo">haunting</a> wilderness with views <a href="##" title="estendersi">stretching</a> as far as Scotland’s highest mountain, Ben Nevis. </p>

<h2 id="5-loch-maree">5. LOCH MAREE</h2>

<p>This peaceful and remote body of water in the northwest Highlands is home to over sixty islands, including one that, uniquely in Britain, contains a small loch that itself contains an island. The Isle of Maree is home to the remains of an ancient 8th-century <a href="##" title="ermo, monastero">hermitage</a>, while much of the area is covered in rare Caledonian pine. Wildlife includes <a href="##" title="martore dei pini">pine martens</a>, Scottish wildcats and even <a href="##" title="aquile reali">golden eagles</a>. The massive <a href="##" title="mole, volume">bulk</a> of Slioch mountain <a href="##" title="incombere">looms</a> above the northeast shores, while the Victoria Falls, named after the queen’s visit in 1877, <a href="##" title="cadere, precipitare">tumble down</a> the western side. </p>
