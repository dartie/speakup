**Lisa**: Are you still on your phone? We were supposed to leave half an hour ago!
**Tom**: Oh, sorry, I lost track of the time.
**Lisa**:  You know you [waste](## "sprecare") hours on that thing. What is it now, social media? Online shopping?
**Tom**:  Hey, leave me alone! I’m not that bad!
**Lisa**:  Not that bad?!? You’re always [staring](## "fissare (con lo sguardo)") at that screen from the moment you wake up!
**Tom**:  Perhaps I do spend a little too much time on it, but it’s not like it’s a problem.
**Lisa**:  But it is! You’re an addict! 
**Tom**:  Oh, come on! That’s not fair. You’re blowing it out of proportion.
**Lisa**: OK, let’s see, [shall we](## "lo facciamo?")? Did we get the cinema too late to see the film yesterday? Did we go overdrawn last month because of an online [order](## "ordine") you forgot about?
**Tom**: Perhaps, but that doesn’t mean I’m addicted.
**Lisa**: Prove it, then! [Put down](## "to put down") that phone right now.
**Tom**: I will! As soon as I’ve finished my comment on this post.

## NOW  LET’S  REVIEW  THE  VOCABULARY!
**To lose track of time** means to forget how much time has passed, usually by being distracted.
In this context, **that thing** is a [disparaging](## "denigratorio") term for mobile phone. You can use ‘thing’ to refer to a specific object being discussed. 
**Leave me alone!** is a common exclamation used when someone [is bothering](## "infastidire") or [harassing](## "molestare") you. You can also say, “Leave me in peace!” or “Stop bothering me!”
**It’s not like**followed by a [clause](## "clausola, proposizione"), is a popular way of saying that something is not true, by comparing it with something worse.
**Come on!** is an expression used to indicate indignation, disagreement or anger.
**Fair**means ‘just’ or ‘reasonable’.
When you make something sound more serious or important than it is, you**blow it out of proportion**.
When more money has been taken out of a bank account than it contains, the account becomes **overdrawn.**
