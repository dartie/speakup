<p>It’s a bird! It’s a plane! No, it’s the Goodyear <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a>! The Goodyear <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a> is an American icon that has <a href="##" title="librarsi, volare">hovered</a> over some of the world’s biggest events. <a href="##" title="avvistare">Spotted</a> over the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup and the Super Bowl, it is easy to forget that the helium-filled airship started life as a <a href="##" title="stravagante">flamboyant</a> advert for a US <a href="##" title="pneumatici">tyre</a> and <a href="##" title="gomma">rubber</a> firm. This year, in celebration of the 100th birthday of its first launch, a Goodyear <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a> will fly over sporting, cultural and music events held in over one hundred cities across North America and Europe, capturing live aerial <a href="##" title="video, filmato">footage</a> of these events.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-the-pilgrim">INTRODUCING THE PILGRIM</h2>

<p>Founded in 1898, the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is an American multinational that specialises in <a href="##" title="pneumatici">tyre</a>s for all kinds of vehicles. During the 20th century, it constructed various types of airships and <a href="##" title="palloni aerostatici">balloons</a>, mostly for the US Navy. In 1925, it introduced the first Goodyear <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a>, called the <a href="##" title="pellegrino">Pilgrim</a>. This non-rigid airship was used as an enormous floating <a href="##" title="cartellone, annuncio">billboard</a>, publicising the firm to millions of Americans. Blimps began appearing all over the country: over <a href="##" title="parate">parades</a>, during holidays and major events, <a href="##" title="catturare l’immaginazione">capturing the imagination</a> of the public. The Goodyear <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a> became famous, and has been the subject of songs, books, films and more. </p>

<h2 id="sporting-events">SPORTING EVENTS</h2>

<p>In 1955, the US TV network NBC asked Goodyear to use its <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a> to help it capture live <a href="##" title="video, filmato">footage</a> of the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl football game, held every New Year’s Day in Pasadena, California. Goodyear agreed, and soon its <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a>s were filming major events all over the US from the sky. 
The company introduced its first international <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a>, Europa, in 1972. After debuting in the UK, it travelled to Italy to capture iconic <a href="##" title="monumenti">landmarks</a> such as the Tower of Pisa and the Colosseum in Rome. In Frankfurt, Germany, it flew over the opening ceremony of the 1974 World Cup. Today, Goodyear has a <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a> permanently based in the German city of Essen. It captures aerial <a href="##" title="video, filmato">footage</a> of major events across Europe, and unlike the US-based <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a>s, it can also carry commercial passengers.</p>

<h2 id="new-model-blimps">NEW MODEL BLIMPS</h2>

<p>Goodyear’s <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a>s ordinarily fly at around one thousand [300m] to 1,500 feet [450m] and at 40mph [64kph]. The original <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a>, the <a href="##" title="pellegrino">Pilgrim</a>, was just over a hundred feet [30m] long and only had space inside for a pilot and two passengers. It was later replaced with larger models. Then, in 2014, Goodyear began replacing its non-rigid airships with the four semi-rigid airships that it uses today. These new airships are almost 250 feet [76m] long and have seating for eight passengers. Although they are not technically <a href="##" title="dirigibile">blimp</a>s (because they are semi-rigid) the company continues to refer to them as such.</p>
