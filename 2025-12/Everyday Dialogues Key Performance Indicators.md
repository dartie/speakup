Dave: Our sales performance is down compared to last year. We need to analyse what’s working and what isn’t.
Laura: I agree. We’re tracking a lot of data, but I’m not sure it [aligns](## "allineare, essere coerente") with our strategic [goal](## "obiettivo") of expanding into new markets. 
Dave: We need to identify the right KPIs. After all, we can’t [improve](## "migliorare") what we don’t measure.
Laura: How about lead generation? A good KPI could be the number of leads from our new market campaigns. 
Dave: Yes! And the conversion rates from those leads, too. That directly supports the expansion [goal](## "obiettivo"). What else?
Laura: I’d like to see a KPI for our CAC within those new markets: how much is it costing us to acquire new [customer](## "cliente")s?
Dave: Great. Then we can see how effective our sales & marketing spend is. What about operations?
Laura: Hmm, there, we should look at a KPI for delivery times in the new regions. We can see if our service [matches](## "corrispondere") what we promise.
Dave: Perfect. Now, how can we make sure these KPIs are clearly defined and everyone understands how they support our strategy?
Laura: We’ll set up a dedicated team. They can review them every month to track progress and adjust them if necessary. 
Dave: Then, hopefully, our performance in the new markets will [improve](## "migliorare").

## NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!
Sales performance means how much a company sells within a specific [timeframe](## "periodo di tempo"). 
Tracking refers to monitoring and measuring to [gather](## "accogliere, riunire") data.
KPI is short for ‘[key performance indicator](## "indicatore chiave di prestazione")’. These quantifiable metrics are used to evaluate the success of a company or specific activity.
A lead is a person or company who has shown interest in a product or service and could potentially become a [customer](## "cliente").
In the context of sales, conversion rate is the percentage of leads who have been converted into [customer](## "cliente")s.
CAC is short for ‘[customer](## "cliente") acquisition cost’. This metric measures how much a company spends to gain a new [customer](## "cliente").
Sales & marketing spend is the total amount of money spent on promoting products and services to acquire (and retain) [customer](## "cliente")s and [increase](## "aumentare") sales. It is used in CAC calculations.
Delivery time refers to how long it takes for a [purchased](## "acquistare") product to [reach](## "raggiungere") the [customer](## "cliente"), after [the order has been placed](## "effettuare un ordine").
In this context, progress is the advancement towards achieving a [goal](## "obiettivo").
