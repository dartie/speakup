<p>Dave: Our sales performance is down compared to last year. We need to analyse what’s working and what isn’t.
Laura: I agree. We’re tracking a lot of data, but I’m not sure it <a href="##" title="allineare, essere coerente">aligns</a> with our strategic <a href="##" title="obiettivo">goal</a> of expanding into new markets. 
Dave: We need to identify the right KPIs. After all, we can’t <a href="##" title="migliorare">improve</a> what we don’t measure.
Laura: How about lead generation? A good KPI could be the number of leads from our new market campaigns. 
Dave: Yes! And the conversion rates from those leads, too. That directly supports the expansion <a href="##" title="obiettivo">goal</a>. What else?
Laura: I’d like to see a KPI for our CAC within those new markets: how much is it costing us to acquire new <a href="##" title="cliente">customer</a>s?
Dave: Great. Then we can see how effective our sales &amp; marketing spend is. What about operations?
Laura: Hmm, there, we should look at a KPI for delivery times in the new regions. We can see if our service <a href="##" title="corrispondere">matches</a> what we promise.
Dave: Perfect. Now, how can we make sure these KPIs are clearly defined and everyone understands how they support our strategy?
Laura: We’ll set up a dedicated team. They can review them every month to track progress and adjust them if necessary. 
Dave: Then, hopefully, our performance in the new markets will <a href="##" title="migliorare">improve</a>.</p>
