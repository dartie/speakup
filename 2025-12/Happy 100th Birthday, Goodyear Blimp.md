It’s a bird! It’s a plane! No, it’s the Goodyear [blimp](## "dirigibile")! The Goodyear [blimp](## "dirigibile") is an American icon that has [hovered](## "librarsi, volare") over some of the world’s biggest events. [Spotted](## "avvistare") over the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup and the Super Bowl, it is easy to forget that the helium-filled airship started life as a [flamboyant](## "stravagante") advert for a US [tyre](## "pneumatici") and [rubber](## "gomma") firm. This year, in celebration of the 100th birthday of its first launch, a Goodyear [blimp](## "dirigibile") will fly over sporting, cultural and music events held in over one hundred cities across North America and Europe, capturing live aerial [footage](## "video, filmato") of these events.

## INTRODUCING THE PILGRIM
Founded in 1898, the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is an American multinational that specialises in [tyre](## "pneumatici")s for all kinds of vehicles. During the 20th century, it constructed various types of airships and [balloons](## "palloni aerostatici"), mostly for the US Navy. In 1925, it introduced the first Goodyear [blimp](## "dirigibile"), called the [Pilgrim](## "pellegrino"). This non-rigid airship was used as an enormous floating [billboard](## "cartellone, annuncio"), publicising the firm to millions of Americans. Blimps began appearing all over the country: over [parades](## "parate"), during holidays and major events, [capturing the imagination](## "catturare l’immaginazione") of the public. The Goodyear [blimp](## "dirigibile") became famous, and has been the subject of songs, books, films and more. 

## SPORTING EVENTS
In 1955, the US TV network NBC asked Goodyear to use its [blimp](## "dirigibile") to help it capture live [footage](## "video, filmato") of the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl football game, held every New Year’s Day in Pasadena, California. Goodyear agreed, and soon its [blimp](## "dirigibile")s were filming major events all over the US from the sky. 
The company introduced its first international [blimp](## "dirigibile"), Europa, in 1972. After debuting in the UK, it travelled to Italy to capture iconic [landmarks](## "monumenti") such as the Tower of Pisa and the Colosseum in Rome. In Frankfurt, Germany, it flew over the opening ceremony of the 1974 World Cup. Today, Goodyear has a [blimp](## "dirigibile") permanently based in the German city of Essen. It captures aerial [footage](## "video, filmato") of major events across Europe, and unlike the US-based [blimp](## "dirigibile")s, it can also carry commercial passengers.

## NEW MODEL BLIMPS
Goodyear’s [blimp](## "dirigibile")s ordinarily fly at around one thousand [300m] to 1,500 feet [450m] and at 40mph [64kph]. The original [blimp](## "dirigibile"), the [Pilgrim](## "pellegrino"), was just over a hundred feet [30m] long and only had space inside for a pilot and two passengers. It was later replaced with larger models. Then, in 2014, Goodyear began replacing its non-rigid airships with the four semi-rigid airships that it uses today. These new airships are almost 250 feet [76m] long and have seating for eight passengers. Although they are not technically [blimp](## "dirigibile")s (because they are semi-rigid) the company continues to refer to them as such.
