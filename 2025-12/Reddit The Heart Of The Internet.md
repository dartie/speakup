Reddit is an online platform with over a hundred million daily active users. Describing itself as “the heart of the internet,” the platform, launched in 2005, has become one of the ten most visited websites. A place where people connect over common interests, it has been both influential and, at times, controversial. It has [triggered](## "scatenare") acts of political and social activism that have influenced real-world events, including a financial market [upheaval](## "sconvolgimento") in 2021.

## RISING VALUE
Reddit was founded in 2005 by University of Virginia graduates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. The pair sold the platform to Condé Nast a year later for an [undisclosed](## "non rivelata") sum of between $10 and $20 million. In 2008, the platform introduced subreddits: communities focused on specific interests. A year on, it introduced Ask Me Anything forums, where users can ask famous people questions. Past participants include Bill Gates, Barack Obama and Elon Musk. Now [headquartered in](## "con sede a") San Francisco, California, the platform is valued at around $20 billion.

## MORE ABOUT SUBREDDITS
If Reddit is the heart of the internet, then subreddits are the heart of Reddit. The online platform has over one hundred thousand active subreddits, with the most popular ones exploring aspects of humour, [gaming](## "videogiochi"), movies, music and world news. Users [submit](## "inviare, caricare") relevant content in the form of text posts, links, images and videos, comment on posts, and participate in conversations. They can also [rank](## "classificare") content, by [upvoting or downvoting](## "votare a favore o contro") posts and comments, so influencing their visibility. The content with the most upvotes appears prominently in subreddits, and potentially on Reddit’s homepage.

## MISINFORMATION
Like many platforms, Reddit has often been accused of [spreading](## "diffondere") extremist views and [misinformation](## "disinformazione") [in the guise of](## "con il pretesto di") [free speech](## "libertà d'espressione"). In 2015, it began [banning](## "vietare") hate-based subreddits. In 2021, one of its subreddits, r/wallstreetbets, was at the centre of a financial controversy, after its users orchestrated a coordinated acquisition of [stock](## "azioni") belonging to the US [retailer](## "rivenditore") GameStop. This caused what is known as a ‘short squeeze’, which cost [hedge funds](## "fondi speculativi") billions of dollars in losses. The controversy was the subject of Ben Mezrich’s book The Antisocial Network (2021) and the 2023 movie Dumb Money.

## IT’S HUMAN
Today, Reddit uses [AI](## "intelligenza artificiale") to help with moderation and user safety. Despite previous controversy, it continues to [soar](## "crescere, impennarsi") in popularity. “Reddit works because it’s human,” co-founder Steve Huffman wrote in a recent Reddit post: “It’s one of the few places online where real people share real opinions. That authenticity is what gives Reddit its value.”
