<p>Una Tradwife (neologismo traducibile come &ldquo;moglie tradizionale&rdquo;) è una donna che crede nel ritorno ai ruoli di genere tradizionali. L&rsquo;influencer Ask Charlie, però, non abbraccia questo concetto.</p>

<p>The ‘tradwife’ movement (tradwife is a <a href="##" title="parola macedonia, parola composta">portmanteau</a> of ‘traditional wife’) is a controversial trend that has gained traction online. Defined as a lifestyle in which women <a href="##" title="accettare">embrace</a> traditional gender roles, dedicating themselves to <a href="##" title="cura della casa">homemaking</a> and <a href="##" title="crescita dei figli">child-rearing</a>, tradwives represent a return to ideals of femininity of the past.
The online movement has gained significant popularity on social media since 2020, where ‘tradwifery’ is presented as a personal choice <a href="##" title="avvolgere">shrouded</a> in nostalgia and <a href="##" title="mettere in scena">staged</a> through idyllic scenes of domestic <a href="##" title="felicità">bliss</a>. However, it became associated with the ideas long held by the Christian right, particularly in the US, who see gender roles as biologically- and divinely-<a href="##" title="stabiliti">ordained</a>. For some of its followers, these roles offer <a href="##" title="realizzazione personale">fulfilment</a> in an age of <a href="##" title="angoscia, ansia esistenziale">angst</a> and instability, while its critics view them as part of a propaganda campaign serving a far-right <a href="##" title="piano, propositi">agenda</a>.</p>

<h2 id="charlie-gray">CHARLIE GRAY</h2>

<p>Charlie Gray is a British homemaker and influencer who offers hugely popular tutorials on a range of <a href="##" title="cura della casa">homemaking</a> skills on her website Ask Charlie, as well as on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. The homemaker, who lives with her family in the beautiful West Sussex countryside, argues that although she is devoted to her husband and three children, she is definitely not a tradwife and prefers to call herself a “professional homemaker” instead. 
As she explains, she launched Ask Charlie in 2018 with the <a href="##" title="obiettivo">aim</a> of helping people of all genders and backgrounds help themselves; the tradwife movement’s renunciation of women working outside the home, and promotion of the husband as <a href="##" title="unico sostegno economico">sole provider</a>, just didn’t work for her or her family. 
<strong>Charlie Gray (English Accent):</strong> The term means a traditional wife that is a housewife that stays at home, that doesn’t work, that doesn’t earn money, that supports her husband, so he can go out and work, and she <a href="##" title="crescere i figli">raises the family</a>. How many of these tradwives are actually doing that? They’ve got a <a href="##" title="lavoro extra">side hustle</a>, so they’re not a tradwife. It’s, I think, a <a href="##" title="assurdo">nonsense</a> term, but I don’t identify with [it]. I have traditional values, but I wouldn’t say I’m a tradwife because I <a href="##" title="dirigere">run</a> my own business, and that’s not a traditional wife in the true meaning of the word. But actually it’s housewife really, rather than tradwife. It’s what it should be. </p>

<h2 id="negative-comments">NEGATIVE COMMENTS</h2>

<p>We then asked Charlie how she deals with unconstructive, negative or trollish comments online…  
<strong>Charlie Gray:</strong> You can’t <a href="##" title="compiacere">please</a> everybody, and you’re not going to be everybody’s cup of tea. And I think I was brought up to treat other people as you would like to be treated, and if you haven’t got anything nice to say, then say nothing at all. So initially I was a bit <a href="##" title="sorprendere, lasciare perplesso">taken aback</a> by the negative comments because why say it? If you don’t like what somebody’s doing, then don’t watch it. But some people seem to really enjoy writing negativity and <a href="##" title="cercare difetti, criticare">picking holes</a> in other people. And I think that’s actually quite sad. I feel actually sorry for people that feel the need to do that. </p>

<h2 id="laugh-it-off">LAUGH IT OFF</h2>

<p>So, does she have any tips for those affected by such comments? 
<strong>Charlie Gray:</strong> It used to <a href="##" title="infastidire">bother</a> me and now I’ve learned that unless they actually have got to know me, unless they’ve come and lived with me, spent time with me or a close friend of mine, I can’t take their opinion to heart, because they’re just making an assumption on a video or on something or other, and they don’t know the real me. And if I’m happy with who I am as a person and how I treat other people, then that’s all that’s important. So I think that’s how I kind of <a href="##" title="farsene una ragione, venirne a capo">get my head around it</a>. It was quite funny, my son read some negative comments and he laughed and he said, “They don’t know you, mum, like, it’s actually funny what they’re writing ‘cause they don’t know who you are.”</p>
