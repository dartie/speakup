<p>Un aspetto essenziale di ogni monarchia è quello di fornire stabilità nei momenti difficili. Tuttavia, l&rsquo;ascesa al trono di Re Carlos III al trono ha generato un dibattito sulla necessità di riformare e modernizzare l&rsquo;istituzione.</p>

<p>Charles III is king of the United Kingdom and fourteen other <a href="##" title="regni">realms</a>, including Canada and Australia. He also <a href="##" title="dirigere">heads</a> the Commonwealth, a post-colonial group of fifty-four independent countries comprising 2.4 billion people. <a href="##" title="ereditiere">Heir</a> to the British throne from the age of three, he knows how to execute the ceremonies required of him impeccably, and has proven himself extremely hard-working. Britain is a constitutional monarchy and the sovereign has no direct political power; however, as prince, Charles acquired a reputation for <a href="##" title="spontaneità">candour</a> or, as he puts it, for “<a href="##" title="impicciarsi">sticking my head</a> above the parapet and generally getting it <a href="##" title="arrancar de un disparo">shot off</a> for <a href="##" title="señalar">pointing out</a> what has always been <a href="##" title="accecantemente ovvio">blindingly obvious</a> to me.” </p>

<h2 id="en-education">en education</h2>

<p>Born in London’s Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1948, Charles Philip Arthur George grew up in a world of immense privilege, but also <a href="##" title="predestinato">preordained</a> <a href="##" title="dovere">duty</a>. In 1952, his grandfather George VI died prematurely and his twenty-five-year-old mother became Queen Elizabeth II. Charles’ <a href="##" title="infanzia">childhood</a> was marked by absent, distant parents who continually <a href="##" title="andare in giro">toured</a>. His trajectory was determined by a committee that included the Prime Minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury. 
<a href="##" title="invece di">Rather than</a> be <a href="##" title="istruire a casa">home-schooled</a>, the prince was sent to the strict Gordonstoun <a href="##" title="collegio">boarding school</a> in Scotland, an experience that he later described as “a prison sentence.” He then spent a year at Geelong <a href="##" title="istituto di studi secondari">Grammar School</a> in Victoria, Australia, before <a href="##" title="finire a">ending up</a> at Trinity College, Cambridge in the UK, where he studied archaeology, anthropology and then history. His degree was the first ever <a href="##" title="guadagnare">earned</a> by an heir to the British crown.</p>

<h2 id="prince-of-wales">PRINCE OF WALES</h2>

<p>In the 1970s there was an unemployment crisis in Britain and sentiment was turning against the royal family. Charles, named Prince of Wales in 1969 (a title that is not hereditary) was sent to the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth to study Welsh history and language. His mentor was Edward Millward, an eminent academic and a Welsh nationalist. Charles took the title seriously and became a dedicated advocate of Welsh <a href="##" title="problemi">issues</a>.
Charles’ personal interests were all carefully chosen and approved by royal <a href="##" title="consiglieri">advisors</a> as what were then considered non-political causes: ecology, architecture, <a href="##" title="del Medio Oriente">Middle Eastern</a> art and alternative medicine. He approached them with passion; in 1970, he made a speech condemning the “horrifying effects” of all forms of pollution and called attention to the threat <a href="##" title="risultare, posare">posed</a> by “indestructible plastic containers.” </p>

<h2 id="black-spider-memos">BLACK SPIDER MEMOS</h2>

<p>After leaving university, Charles served in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. He returned in 1976 to found the Prince&rsquo;s <a href="##" title="fondazione">Trust</a>, a charity that offers <a href="##" title="istruzione pratica">skills training</a> to thousands of young Britons. Critical of modern architecture, he founded the Prince of Wales’ Institute of Architecture, an organisation involved with urban regeneration and development projects. He set up the organic food <a href="##" title="marchio">brand</a> <a href="##" title="ducato">Duchy</a> Originals as part of his questioning of modern farming methods. In 1998, he founded the Prince’s Foundation, dedicated to a more sustainable future for Britain.
Prince Charles’ interest in good causes <a href="##" title="divertire">amused</a> the popular press and he was <a href="##" title="dare un nomignolo">nicknamed</a> Britain’s “<a href="##" title="preoccupato-in- comando">worrier-in-chief</a>.” But the revelation that he was writing letters — so-called “black spider memos”, a reference to his <a href="##" title="calligrafia">handwriting</a> — <a href="##" title="mettere fretta">urging</a> <a href="##" title="membri del Parlamento">MPs</a> and even the Prime Minister to take action on key <a href="##" title="problemi">issues</a>, caused serious <a href="##" title="preoccupazione">concern</a>. While the content of his memos <a href="##" title="risultare in">turned out</a> to be benign, it opened a debate on the degree to which the royal family can influence the government.</p>

<h2 id="troubled-times">TROUBLED TIMES</h2>

<p>Charles III ascended the throne in September with Britain’s <a href="##" title="eredità">legacy</a> of colonialism still <a href="##" title="pesare a">weighing it down</a>. Jamaica, New Zealand and Australia may all <a href="##" title="rimuovere">remove</a> him as head of state in his lifetime. The King has also inherited family scandals: in 2021 his brother Prince Andrew was <a href="##" title="privare">stripped</a> of his royal duties because of his association with sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, while relations between the King and his son Harry, <a href="##" title="riguardo">regarding</a> his decision <a href="##" title="ritirarsi">to step back</a> from his royal duties, remain tense. There are also serious questions about the <a href="##" title="raccolta fondi">fundraising</a> activities of Charles’ charitable operations. The police are investigating the Prince’s Foundation after <a href="##" title="accuse">allegations</a> of offers of honours or British <a href="##" title="cittadinanza">citizenship</a> in exchange for massive donations. </p>

<h2 id="the-near-future">THE NEAR FUTURE</h2>

<p>So, <a href="##" title="ciò che il futuro ha in serbo">what does the immediate future <a href="##" title="mantenere">hold</a></a> for the British monarchy? There are plans <a href="##" title="restringere">to slim it down</a> to just seven key members of senior working royals. There will be a more rapid and agile approach to communications and greater transparency. It has been reported that King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, may move into an apartment in Buckingham Palace, like <a href="##" title="un appartamento sopra un negozio">a “flat above a shop.”</a> There may also be increased public access to the Palace and gardens.</p>

<h2 id="speaking-up">SPEAKING UP</h2>

<p>The King has insisted that he will take a different approach as monarch from his <a href="##" title="scontroso">opinionated</a> time as Prince, and will never be openly political. He will still, however, <a href="##" title="mantenere">hold</a> a weekly audience with the Prime Minister in conditions of absolute confidentiality. What happens behind these closed doors is a matter of interest; after all, the new king is of the opinion that planet Earth is <a href="##" title="affrontare">facing</a> catastrophe, while the new UK Government seems less convinced. Some believe that <a href="##" title="molto è in gioco">the stakes are so high</a> that while Charles III may not be an <a href="##" title="schietto, aperto">outspoken</a> King, he may be a King that risks constitutional crisis by <a href="##" title="portare avanti">speaking out</a> on certain <a href="##" title="problemi">issues</a>.</p>

<h2 id="camilla-rottweiler-to-queen-consort">Camilla: Rottweiler to Queen Consort</h2>

<p>Charles’ personal life has been much scrutinised. In 1981 he married Lady Diana Spencer in a royal wedding that was a global media event. Their sons Prince William and Prince Henry (known as Harry) were born in 1982 and 1984. Charles’ marriage to Diana <a href="##" title="collassare">collapsed</a> <a href="##" title="in mezzo">amidst</a> rumours of infidelity with Camilla Parker-Bowles, with whom he had a <a href="##" title="a lungo termine">long-standing</a> relationship. A transcript of a suggestive, secretly-recorded 1989 phone conversation between them (known as ‘Camillagate’) <a href="##" title="peggiorare le cose">made matters worse</a>. Princess Diana even <a href="##" title="riportato">reportedly</a> called Camilla a “rottweiler&rdquo;. In 1996, Charles and Diana divorced and a year later Diana died in a car crash. Popular feeling for her was so great that many questioned Charles’ <a href="##" title="idoneità">suitability</a> to be monarch at all, while Camilla was <a href="##" title="villificato">vilified</a>. He subsequently spent much effort and <a href="##" title="spesa">expense</a> in modernising his public image and gradually began appearing in public with Camilla. They quietly married in 2005 and she, <a href="##" title="con il tempo">over time</a>, won respect as the future king&rsquo;s loyal wife. While Camilla never took the title Princess of Wales, associated with Diana, she now becomes the Queen Consort as the wife of a reigning king.</p>
