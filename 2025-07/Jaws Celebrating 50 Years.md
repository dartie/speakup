You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” It’s been fifty years since audiences first heard this famous line in the film [Jaws](## "mascelle"), one of the most iconic quotes in the history of cinema. [Released](## "uscire") in 1975, [Jaws](## "mascelle") went on to become a cultural phenomenon, and the line would become a popular American [catchphrase](## "motto"), used when someone is faced with a situation that is much more [challenging](## "difficile") or complex than they initially anticipated.

## MALFUNCTIONING SHARKS
Directed by Steven Spielberg, [Jaws](## "mascelle") is based on a novel by Peter Benchley and [stars](## "avere come protagonista") Martin Brody as a police chief, Richard Dreyfuss as a marine biologist, and Robert Shaw as a professional shark hunter. Together, the three men hunt a man-eating great white shark that has been attacking people at a beach community on the fictional Amity Island. 

## BAD WEATHER 
Mostly filmed on and off the island of Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, the film was marred6 by bad weather, causing it [to go over budget](## "sforare il budget") and [over schedule](## "andare oltre la scadenza"). Also, its three $150,000 animatronic sharks often malfunctioned, and so Spielberg had to mostly suggest [rather than](## "invece di") show the shark, which he did [to great effect](## "con grande efficacia"). 

## BRUCE THE SHARK
[Nevertheless](## "ciò nonostante"), the problematic shark had such a presence on the film set that [crew members](## "membri della produzione") named it Bruce, after Steven Spielberg’s lawyer, Bruce Ramer. The great white in the film was 25 feet long [7.62m] — a shark of that size would have [weighed](## "pesare") 4.9 tons in real life. In reality, however, the largest great white shark ever recorded was only 19.7ft [6m] long as measured in Ledge Point, Western Australia, when [caught](## "catturare, pescare") in 1987. 

## HUGE SUCCESS
The film [thrilled](## "entusiasmare") and terrified audiences worldwide, although the shark actually ‘only’ kills five people, including — spoiler alert — Quint, Robert Shaw’s character, and one dog. Made for less than $9 million, it made over $470 million, making it the [highest-grossing](## "con il maggior incasso") film of all time — until the release of Star Wars two years later. It won three Academy Awards, including one for John Williams’ brilliant [soundtrack](## "colonna sonora") and inspired three sequels, with an [overall](## "totale") [kill count](## "numero totale di morti") of thirty people.  

## THE ORIGINAL SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER
Today, [Jaws](## "mascelle") is considered the prototypical summer [blockbuster](## "successo commerciale"), characterised as a simple-concept, high-budget and high-grossing film. It had an exceptionally wide release, was accompanied by an exceptionally extensive marketing campaign, and attracted an exceptionally large audience for a film at that time. Realising the success of the formula, film studios began replicating it every summer, and so the summer [blockbuster](## "successo commerciale") was born.
