# Waiting Room: A Short Story   [C1]

Dopo un incidente, un uomo affronta una lotta interiore contro l’angoscia, il senso di colpa e la confusione. Nell’attesa, la sua mente si perde tra ricordi, desideri non realizzati e il peso di ciò che avrebbe potuto essere e non sarà mai.

I  hate hospitals with their [stink](## "puzza") of disinfectant and sick people. I’d try to sleep, but they make these plastic chairs so uncomfortable. The nurse told me to wait here, but I’ll go home soon. I can’t do anything for Ilga.
I’m starving. I’ve had nothing to eat since that packet of [crisps](## "patatine") in the pub. Lucky I’d taken Jayden to his mum’s. She complained, of course, as she always does. “It’s your weekend, Ian! You’ll never change.” Well it was [a piece of luck](## "un colpo di fortuna"), actually, because he’s [best off there](## "stare meglio così"). Though I can’t call him. My phone was destroyed.
I can see the sandwiches in the vending machine from here. I gave it a [shove](## "empujón") earlier, and this old guy sitting nearby [gave me a dirty look](## "guardare male"). I told him my money’d got stuck.
I shouldn’t have listened to Theresa. She told me to leave my bank card at home and use cash to save money. She’s always [nagging](## "tormentare, assillare") me: “Ian, Jayden needs new [trainers](## "scarpe da ginnastica")! Ian, you spend a fortune on [booze](## "alcol")!” Like it’s her business, I’m not even with her any more. Well, not exactly. If I had my card I could go and get some cash. Like my [mate](## "amico, collega") Ant always says, ‘Ian, never listen to a woman; you’re too soft, [mate](## "amico, collega").’ He’s right, but I [can’t help it](## "non ci posso fare niente").
I [could murder a fag](## "darei qualsiasi cosa per una sigaretta"). I lost my packet in the accident. 
The thing is, I’m not getting any [sympathy](## "compassione") because I don’t even look like I’ve been in an accident. All I’ve got is a couple of [scratches](## "graffi"), and Ilga’s… well. Anyway, no one cares about me!
 I’ve been here for hours. There’s not even a clock in this place and my phone won’t even turn on. The weird thing is, I wish Jayden was here. What is he, nine… ten now? He’s a good kid. I wish I could call him, just to hear his voice. How stupid’s that? It’s the accident, I s’pose.
That guy’s going out for a smoke. I [could murder a fag](## "darei qualsiasi cosa per una sigaretta").
I’d only just bought that phone off Ant. The police asked me if I’d been using it at the time of the accident. I told them it’d been in my back pocket. It would’ve been if that… Ilga had remembered the address. I had to look it up as we were going along, and then…  No! Now I’ve thought about it, I can’t get it out of my head, how she just [flew off](## "volare via") the [bike](## "moto") and…
‘Scuse me, [mate](## "amico, collega")! You haven’t got a [ciggy](## "sigaretta"), have you? I’m sorry, it’s just my girlfriend’s in there and…’
Bastard! Of course he’s got some left. I always give fags to people when they ask. That’s how I met Ilga. She asked me for one in the pub and then ended up playing [pool](## "biliardo") with me and Ant. We had a few drinks and she made me laugh. I kept calling her Olga and she kept [giggling](## "ridacchiare"). She’s got a sense of humour. Not like Theresa. I s’pose Ilga’s a lot younger than Theresa — ten, fifteen years younger. She told me she thought I was about thirty-five when she saw me. Thirty-five! I s’pose I keep myself all right. I’m not fat like some [blokes](## "tipi") I know — like Ant.
We met up a few times, me and Ilga, and then one thing led to another. Couple of weeks back we ended up in her tiny [bedsit](## "monolocale"). God, it was worse than my place, but it was a good night. She wanted me to meet some of her friends in this nightclub. I wasn’t interested, but she kept smiling at me with those blue eyes and saying she’d [make it worth my while](## "farmi valere la pena") and I [gave in](## "cedere"). Like I said, I’m soft. So we were going to a club on the other side of town in the rain. Only she couldn’t remember the address and I had to get my phone out.
Don’t let me think about it. Makes me want [to puke](## "vomitare"). I mean, it was so fast. SO FAST! One minute we’re [racing along](## "correre, fare la gara"), next minute the [bike](## "moto")’s [skidding](## "sbandare") and I’m hanging on, trying to keep it upright, and the phone’s slipping out of my hand, but there was NOTHING I could do. We went over and the [windshield](## "parabrezza") kind of protected me, but she… she just [flew off](## "volare via") like a doll. It was horrible!
I should go. I should call Theresa from the [front desk](## "bancone della reception") or something. She’ll complain, but then, she’ll [sort something out](## "risolvere"). She always does. Oh God, that nurse is coming back. She’s going to tell me Ilga’s dead! Why didn’t I leave? 
“Yeah, I’m Ian Foster. She’s asking for me? What? She’s sitting up in bed? She’s hungry? But I thought she was… Oh, God bless her! Sorry, nurse… look at me, crying like a baby. I don’t know why. The shock, yeah! Oh, thank God , thank God … Sorry nurse, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. No, I don’t need to sit down again. I’ll go in now.
