<p>Dopo un incidente, un uomo affronta una lotta interiore contro l’angoscia, il senso di colpa e la confusione. Nell’attesa, la sua mente si perde tra ricordi, desideri non realizzati e il peso di ciò che avrebbe potuto essere e non sarà mai.</p>

<p>I  hate hospitals with their <a href="##" title="puzza">stink</a> of disinfectant and sick people. I’d try to sleep, but they make these plastic chairs so uncomfortable. The nurse told me to wait here, but I’ll go home soon. I can’t do anything for Ilga.
I’m starving. I’ve had nothing to eat since that packet of <a href="##" title="patatine">crisps</a> in the pub. Lucky I’d taken Jayden to his mum’s. She complained, of course, as she always does. “It’s your weekend, Ian! You’ll never change.” Well it was <a href="##" title="un colpo di fortuna">a piece of luck</a>, actually, because he’s <a href="##" title="stare meglio così">best off there</a>. Though I can’t call him. My phone was destroyed.
I can see the sandwiches in the vending machine from here. I gave it a <a href="##" title="empujón">shove</a> earlier, and this old guy sitting nearby <a href="##" title="guardare male">gave me a dirty look</a>. I told him my money’d got stuck.
I shouldn’t have listened to Theresa. She told me to leave my bank card at home and use cash to save money. She’s always <a href="##" title="tormentare, assillare">nagging</a> me: “Ian, Jayden needs new <a href="##" title="scarpe da ginnastica">trainers</a>! Ian, you spend a fortune on <a href="##" title="alcol">booze</a>!” Like it’s her business, I’m not even with her any more. Well, not exactly. If I had my card I could go and get some cash. Like my <a href="##" title="amico, collega">mate</a> Ant always says, ‘Ian, never listen to a woman; you’re too soft, <a href="##" title="amico, collega">mate</a>.’ He’s right, but I <a href="##" title="non ci posso fare niente">can’t help it</a>.
I <a href="##" title="darei qualsiasi cosa per una sigaretta">could murder a fag</a>. I lost my packet in the accident. 
The thing is, I’m not getting any <a href="##" title="compassione">sympathy</a> because I don’t even look like I’ve been in an accident. All I’ve got is a couple of <a href="##" title="graffi">scratches</a>, and Ilga’s… well. Anyway, no one cares about me!
 I’ve been here for hours. There’s not even a clock in this place and my phone won’t even turn on. The weird thing is, I wish Jayden was here. What is he, nine… ten now? He’s a good kid. I wish I could call him, just to hear his voice. How stupid’s that? It’s the accident, I s’pose.
That guy’s going out for a smoke. I <a href="##" title="darei qualsiasi cosa per una sigaretta">could murder a fag</a>.
I’d only just bought that phone off Ant. The police asked me if I’d been using it at the time of the accident. I told them it’d been in my back pocket. It would’ve been if that… Ilga had remembered the address. I had to look it up as we were going along, and then…  No! Now I’ve thought about it, I can’t get it out of my head, how she just <a href="##" title="volare via">flew off</a> the <a href="##" title="moto">bike</a> and…
‘Scuse me, <a href="##" title="amico, collega">mate</a>! You haven’t got a <a href="##" title="sigaretta">ciggy</a>, have you? I’m sorry, it’s just my girlfriend’s in there and…’
Bastard! Of course he’s got some left. I always give fags to people when they ask. That’s how I met Ilga. She asked me for one in the pub and then ended up playing <a href="##" title="biliardo">pool</a> with me and Ant. We had a few drinks and she made me laugh. I kept calling her Olga and she kept <a href="##" title="ridacchiare">giggling</a>. She’s got a sense of humour. Not like Theresa. I s’pose Ilga’s a lot younger than Theresa — ten, fifteen years younger. She told me she thought I was about thirty-five when she saw me. Thirty-five! I s’pose I keep myself all right. I’m not fat like some <a href="##" title="tipi">blokes</a> I know — like Ant.
We met up a few times, me and Ilga, and then one thing led to another. Couple of weeks back we ended up in her tiny <a href="##" title="monolocale">bedsit</a>. God, it was worse than my place, but it was a good night. She wanted me to meet some of her friends in this nightclub. I wasn’t interested, but she kept smiling at me with those blue eyes and saying she’d <a href="##" title="farmi valere la pena">make it worth my while</a> and I <a href="##" title="cedere">gave in</a>. Like I said, I’m soft. So we were going to a club on the other side of town in the rain. Only she couldn’t remember the address and I had to get my phone out.
Don’t let me think about it. Makes me want <a href="##" title="vomitare">to puke</a>. I mean, it was so fast. SO FAST! One minute we’re <a href="##" title="correre, fare la gara">racing along</a>, next minute the <a href="##" title="moto">bike</a>’s <a href="##" title="sbandare">skidding</a> and I’m hanging on, trying to keep it upright, and the phone’s slipping out of my hand, but there was NOTHING I could do. We went over and the <a href="##" title="parabrezza">windshield</a> kind of protected me, but she… she just <a href="##" title="volare via">flew off</a> like a doll. It was horrible!
I should go. I should call Theresa from the <a href="##" title="bancone della reception">front desk</a> or something. She’ll complain, but then, she’ll <a href="##" title="risolvere">sort something out</a>. She always does. Oh God, that nurse is coming back. She’s going to tell me Ilga’s dead! Why didn’t I leave? 
“Yeah, I’m Ian Foster. She’s asking for me? What? She’s sitting up in bed? She’s hungry? But I thought she was… Oh, God bless her! Sorry, nurse… look at me, crying like a baby. I don’t know why. The shock, yeah! Oh, thank God , thank God … Sorry nurse, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. No, I don’t need to sit down again. I’ll go in now.
