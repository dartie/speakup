<p>You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” It’s been fifty years since audiences first heard this famous line in the film <a href="##" title="mascelle">Jaws</a>, one of the most iconic quotes in the history of cinema. <a href="##" title="uscire">Released</a> in 1975, <a href="##" title="mascelle">Jaws</a> went on to become a cultural phenomenon, and the line would become a popular American <a href="##" title="motto">catchphrase</a>, used when someone is faced with a situation that is much more <a href="##" title="difficile">challenging</a> or complex than they initially anticipated.</p>

<h2 id="malfunctioning-sharks">MALFUNCTIONING SHARKS</h2>

<p>Directed by Steven Spielberg, <a href="##" title="mascelle">Jaws</a> is based on a novel by Peter Benchley and <a href="##" title="avere come protagonista">stars</a> Martin Brody as a police chief, Richard Dreyfuss as a marine biologist, and Robert Shaw as a professional shark hunter. Together, the three men hunt a man-eating great white shark that has been attacking people at a beach community on the fictional Amity Island. </p>

<h2 id="bad-weather">BAD WEATHER </h2>

<p>Mostly filmed on and off the island of Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, the film was marred6 by bad weather, causing it <a href="##" title="sforare il budget">to go over budget</a> and <a href="##" title="andare oltre la scadenza">over schedule</a>. Also, its three $150,000 animatronic sharks often malfunctioned, and so Spielberg had to mostly suggest <a href="##" title="invece di">rather than</a> show the shark, which he did <a href="##" title="con grande efficacia">to great effect</a>. </p>

<h2 id="bruce-the-shark">BRUCE THE SHARK</h2>

<p><a href="##" title="ciò nonostante">Nevertheless</a>, the problematic shark had such a presence on the film set that <a href="##" title="membri della produzione">crew members</a> named it Bruce, after Steven Spielberg’s lawyer, Bruce Ramer. The great white in the film was 25 feet long [7.62m] — a shark of that size would have <a href="##" title="pesare">weighed</a> 4.9 tons in real life. In reality, however, the largest great white shark ever recorded was only 19.7ft [6m] long as measured in Ledge Point, Western Australia, when <a href="##" title="catturare, pescare">caught</a> in 1987. </p>

<h2 id="huge-success">HUGE SUCCESS</h2>

<p>The film <a href="##" title="entusiasmare">thrilled</a> and terrified audiences worldwide, although the shark actually ‘only’ kills five people, including — spoiler alert — Quint, Robert Shaw’s character, and one dog. Made for less than <span class="math inline">\(9 million, it made over \)</span>470 million, making it the <a href="##" title="con il maggior incasso">highest-grossing</a> film of all time — until the release of Star Wars two years later. It won three Academy Awards, including one for John Williams’ brilliant <a href="##" title="colonna sonora">soundtrack</a> and inspired three sequels, with an <a href="##" title="totale">overall</a> <a href="##" title="numero totale di morti">kill count</a> of thirty people.  </p>

<h2 id="the-original-summer-blockbuster">THE ORIGINAL SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER</h2>

<p>Today, <a href="##" title="mascelle">Jaws</a> is considered the prototypical summer <a href="##" title="successo commerciale">blockbuster</a>, characterised as a simple-concept, high-budget and high-grossing film. It had an exceptionally wide release, was accompanied by an exceptionally extensive marketing campaign, and attracted an exceptionally large audience for a film at that time. Realising the success of the formula, film studios began replicating it every summer, and so the summer <a href="##" title="successo commerciale">blockbuster</a> was born.
