<p>Insulti, aggressioni e persino tentativi di aprire le porte dell’aereo durante il volo: il cattivo comportamento di un passeggero non è solo fastidioso, ma può compromettere la sicurezza di tutti i passeggeri.</p>

<p>Flying can be a stressful experience. Passengers have <a href="##" title="orientarsi">to navigate</a> airports, wait in queues and then sit in uncomfortable, <a href="##" title="stretti">narrow</a> seats on a full plane, often for many hours. What’s more, every year hundreds of people add to the stress by <a href="##" title="comportarsi">behaving</a> badly. This can be more than just flying nerves. Some people board the plane drunk, have loud or violent <a href="##" title="discussioni">arguments</a>, or even physically fight with staff or other passengers. There have even been cases when the plane has been forced to make an <a href="##" title="non previsto">unscheduled</a> stop and the passenger(s) removed, at considerable cost. Here are just a few of the many bizarre incidents reported in recent years.</p>

<h2 id="song-on-repeat">SONG ON REPEAT</h2>

<p>We all know that feeling when we can’t stop replaying a song in our heads. However, sometimes it becomes an obsession. On an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to New York, a female passenger wouldn’t stop singing <a href="##" title="cantare a squarciagola">a song out loud</a>, over and over again. The song was I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston and her <a href="##" title="interpretazione">rendition</a> of it was so irritating to other passengers that the flight <a href="##" title="deviare">was diverted</a> to Kansas City, where she <a href="##" title="accompagnare fuori">was escorted off</a> the plane.</p>

<h2 id="a-justified-response">A JUSTIFIED RESPONSE?</h2>

<p>News stories about antagonism between airline passengers have proliferated in recent years. However, some induce more understanding from readers than others. Take the conflict between two passengers that forced a United Airlines flight from New Jersey to Colorado to divert to Chicago. The conflict began when a man used a <a href="##" title="dispositivo">device</a> to stop a woman in front of him reclining in her seat. He then ignored requests from personnel <a href="##" title="rimuovere">to remove</a> the <a href="##" title="dispositivo">device</a>, which is not permitted by the airline. In response, the female passenger threw a cup of water on him, aggravating the situation. Though many felt her response was entirely justified, both passengers were removed from the plane.</p>

<h2 id="emergency-exit">EMERGENCY EXIT</h2>

<p>When we arrive at our destination, all any of us want to do is get off the plane as quickly as possible. One passenger was so impatient to get off a flight when it arrived in Melbourne last summer that he forced open an emergency exit, causing a <a href="##" title="scivolo">slide</a> <a href="##" title="spiegarsi">to deploy</a>. But then, instead of <a href="##" title="scivolare giù">sliding down</a> the <a href="##" title="scivolo">slide</a>, he walked on the <a href="##" title="ala">wing</a> of the plane and slid down the <a href="##" title="motore">engine</a> to the ground, where he was immediately arrested.</p>

<h2 id="serious-trouble">SERIOUS TROUBLE</h2>

<p>Airline passengers who behave badly face strict penalties. They can <a href="##" title="multare">be fined</a> tens of thousands of dollars, <a href="##" title="vietare">be banned</a> for life from flying with the airline, or even go to prison. And yet these punishments don’t prevent the hundreds of incidents of <a href="##" title="ribelle">unruly</a> behaviour that take place each year even though it <a href="##" title="mettere in pericolo">jeopardises</a> the safety of other passengers. Have a safe flight!
