# Bad Airline Behaviour: Anger in the Sky   [B2]

Insulti, aggressioni e persino tentativi di aprire le porte dell’aereo durante il volo: il cattivo comportamento di un passeggero non è solo fastidioso, ma può compromettere la sicurezza di tutti i passeggeri.

Flying can be a stressful experience. Passengers have [to navigate](## "orientarsi") airports, wait in queues and then sit in uncomfortable, [narrow](## "stretti") seats on a full plane, often for many hours. What’s more, every year hundreds of people add to the stress by [behaving](## "comportarsi") badly. This can be more than just flying nerves. Some people board the plane drunk, have loud or violent [arguments](## "discussioni"), or even physically fight with staff or other passengers. There have even been cases when the plane has been forced to make an [unscheduled](## "non previsto") stop and the passenger(s) removed, at considerable cost. Here are just a few of the many bizarre incidents reported in recent years.

## SONG ON REPEAT
We all know that feeling when we can’t stop replaying a song in our heads. However, sometimes it becomes an obsession. On an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to New York, a female passenger wouldn’t stop singing [a song out loud](## "cantare a squarciagola"), over and over again. The song was I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston and her [rendition](## "interpretazione") of it was so irritating to other passengers that the flight [was diverted](## "deviare") to Kansas City, where she [was escorted off](## "accompagnare fuori") the plane.

## A JUSTIFIED RESPONSE?
News stories about antagonism between airline passengers have proliferated in recent years. However, some induce more understanding from readers than others. Take the conflict between two passengers that forced a United Airlines flight from New Jersey to Colorado to divert to Chicago. The conflict began when a man used a [device](## "dispositivo") to stop a woman in front of him reclining in her seat. He then ignored requests from personnel [to remove](## "rimuovere") the [device](## "dispositivo"), which is not permitted by the airline. In response, the female passenger threw a cup of water on him, aggravating the situation. Though many felt her response was entirely justified, both passengers were removed from the plane.

## EMERGENCY EXIT
When we arrive at our destination, all any of us want to do is get off the plane as quickly as possible. One passenger was so impatient to get off a flight when it arrived in Melbourne last summer that he forced open an emergency exit, causing a [slide](## "scivolo") [to deploy](## "spiegarsi"). But then, instead of [sliding down](## "scivolare giù") the [slide](## "scivolo"), he walked on the [wing](## "ala") of the plane and slid down the [engine](## "motore") to the ground, where he was immediately arrested.

## SERIOUS TROUBLE
Airline passengers who behave badly face strict penalties. They can [be fined](## "multare") tens of thousands of dollars, [be banned](## "vietare") for life from flying with the airline, or even go to prison. And yet these punishments don’t prevent the hundreds of incidents of [unruly](## "ribelle") behaviour that take place each year even though it [jeopardises](## "mettere in pericolo") the safety of other passengers. Have a safe flight!
