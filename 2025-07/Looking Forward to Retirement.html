<p>Martina: Hi Joe. We always meet in the kitchen!
Joe: Yes, we do! Can I make you a cup of tea?
Martina: That’d be lovely. So, I hear you’ll be leaving us soon.
Joe: That’s right. I’m finally <a href="##" title="andare in pensione">retiring</a> at the end of this month.
Martina: Wow, it’s the end of an era. How long have you worked here?
Joe: Thirty years, if you can imagine that.
Martina: No, I can’t! But you can’t be sixty-seven already?
Joe:  No, I’m not, but I’m eligible for early retirement.
Martina: Will you still get your full pension?
Joe: No, I’ll get three quarters, but it’s enough to get by, when I add my savings.
Martina: What about social security benefits?
Joe: Oh, for those I do have to wait till I’m sixty-seven.
Martina:  Oh, what a shame. And what will you do with all that free time?
Joe: All those things I never had much time for: travel, hobbies, quality time with my <a href="##" title="nipoti">grandchildren</a>&hellip;
Martina: Sounds great. Enjoy your last month with us. You’ll be missed!</p>
