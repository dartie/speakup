<p>New York City is one of the most expensive cities in the world, but there are still a lot of fun things to do that are free or low-cost! Maybe you have already been to the top of the Empire State Building, <a href="##" title="passeggiare per">strolled through</a> Central Park or even gone to a B<a href="##" title="calzada">roadway</a> show, but there is so much more to do in the city without <a href="##" title="prosciugare il conto">breaking the bank</a>. Read on for a series of <a href="##" title="economico">budget</a> activities that are affordable or even free, perfect for a long weekend in town or if you need to save money during a longer trip.</p>

<h2 id="day-one">DAY ONE</h2>

<p>On your first day in New York we recommend visiting High Line Park, which is open from 7am to 10pm in the warm weather months. Now, this is not your average serene green <a href="##" title="decorato">scene</a>. The park is built on an old two-kilometre-long elevated <a href="##" title="linea ferroviaria per merci">freight line</a> which s<a href="##" title="guarnire, condire">topped</a> being used in 1980. Walking along the park you can see a variety of native and international plant life, as well as a <a href="##" title="alla moda">funky</a> mix of public art, like the 5.8-meter-tall <a href="##" title="piccione, colombo">pigeon</a> sculpture currently on the High Line. There is a lot to see and do at the High Line, such as stargazing8 with telescopes on Tuesday nights at <a href="##" title="crepuscolo">dusk</a> as well as all kinds of exercise classes, like tai chi and zumba, as well as free tours of this cool park.
Next, we’re off to Grand Central Terminal. This Beaux-Arts building is magnificent to look at from the outside and from the inside. Indoors, marvel at the bronze <a href="##" title="lampadari">chandeliers</a> and the celestial ceiling painted with constellations. Downstairs, in front of the Oyster Bar restaurant, there’s a <a href="##" title="galleria dei sussurri"><a href="##" title="sussurrare">whisper</a>ing gallery</a> where if you stand in one corner and <a href="##" title="sussurrare">whisper</a> the person on the opposite side can hear what you’re saying! This <a href="##" title="strana caratteristica">odd feature</a> is an accidental effect caused by the unusual perfect geometry of the arches of the gallery.
In the warmer weather, many of the streets in all five <a href="##" title="distretti">boroughs</a> are closed for the Summer Streets festival. Grand Central takes part by closing the elevated <a href="##" title="calzada">roadway</a> outside the terminal and allowing people to walk around the building for an <a href="##" title="da vicino">up-close</a> look. There’s also a <a href="##" title="area ristorazione">food court</a> downstairs with reasonably priced selections like pierogis at Veselka, an <a href="##" title="punto">outpost</a> of a popular East Village Ukrainian restaurant.
From Grand Central, take the train numbered 4, 5 or 6 to the Brooklyn Bridge and walk over this famous <a href="##" title="punto di riferimento">landmark</a>. You can do this during the day, but it also offers <a href="##" title="mozzafiato, impressionante">stunning</a> views at night. Even though it’s free to cross now, there was  a <a href="##" title="pedaggio">toll</a> for <a href="##" title="pedoni">pedestrians</a> when the bridge first opened in 1883 and it was the longest suspension bridge in the world. From the bridge you get a great view of the skyline and can take some amazing photos. On the other side of the bridge, walk over to the Brooklyn Heights <a href="##" title="passeggiata">Promenade</a> for an even better view of Manhattan. This walkway is <a href="##" title="elevata">raised</a> and it faces Manhattan. It’s the perfect place for a stroll, day or night.</p>

<h2 id="day-two">DAY TWO</h2>

<p>On your second day, start out at the Staten Island Ferry in Lower Manhattan and check out the Statue of Liberty as you travel across the harbour. The best part is that the Staten Island Ferry is free! You can even <a href="##" title="prendere una birra">grab a beer</a> on the boat like so many <a href="##" title="pendolari">commuters</a> do after a hard day at work. If you do want to take a quick look at Staten Island, next to the ferry there is an outlet shopping center and a statue for Staten Islanders who died on <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.
Next, a few blocks away from the ferry on the Manhattan side, go to the National Museum of the American Indian, which is also free. The museum explores the culture of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas with exhibitions, films, music and dance. While at the museum, go into the interactive imagiNATIONS Activity Center. There you can investigate the science behind ingenious inventions that we still use today, like <a href="##" title="biberon">baby bottles</a>, <a href="##" title="amache">hammocks</a>, and suspension bridges. 
You do have to eat at some point, and for the price of a meal at Lady Gaga’s family restaurant, Joanne Trattoria, you can also see drag and magic shows, as well as emerging artists <a href="##" title="rassegna, esposizione">showcases</a>. Entrees start at $28.95 [€27]. Who knows? You may spy Lady Gaga herself enjoying some <a href="##" title="delizioso">yummy</a> Italian food.</p>

<h2 id="day-three">DAY THREE</h2>

<p>Did you know you can go kayaking in New York? On day three, check out one of the two places that offer free kayaking on the East River from May to October. At Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse, be sure to make reservations two weeks before you plan to go. <a href="##" title="tieni in mente">Be advised</a> that there aren’t any <a href="##" title="armadietti">lockers</a> there. The launch point is close to <a href="##" title="molo">Pier</a> 4 Park, which has public bathrooms where you can change. Downtown Boathouse in Manhattan is a bit different. They do not take reservations: it’s first come, first served. It offers not only kayaks and <a href="##" title="giubbotto di salvataggio">life vests</a>, but also <a href="##" title="crema solare">sun block</a> and changing rooms, as well as <a href="##" title="armadietti">lockers</a> and locks. But be warned! If you kayak at either of these places you will most likely get wet. <a href="##" title="per questo motivo">Hence</a> the need for a change of clothes.
After your voyage on the water, get more down to earth at Brooklyn’s picturesque Green-Wood Cemetery. Walking through its ornate iron gate is like walking into another world. <a href="##" title="vagare">Wander</a> through the cemetery’s hills and valleys and explore its <a href="##" title="mozzafiato, impressionante">stunning</a> statues and Gothic Revival, Classical, and Victorian Gothic architecture. There are even a few <a href="##" title="stagni">ponds</a>, but Manhattan is never very far away. You can see it from the cemetery at the highest natural point in Brooklyn, Battle Hill. Green-Wood Cemetery is so much more than a final resting place for artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, composer Leonard Bernstein, and author of Moby-Dick, Herman Melville.
For those fashionistas out there, head over to the museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, or FIT as it is commonly called in New York. The museum has great free exhibits related to fashion and also <a href="##" title="rassegna, esposizione">showcases</a> work done by students of this famous fashion college.
End your evening by visiting some of Chelsea’s many art galleries. There are exhibition <a href="##" title="inaugurazioni">openings</a> of paintings, photographs, and sculptures held every night of the week, but many are held on Thursday evenings. Some of the <a href="##" title="inaugurazioni">openings</a> even have free wine!  </p>

<h2 id="what-to-eat">WHAT TO EAT?</h2>

<p>Food is <a href="##" title="caro, costoso">pricey</a> in Manhattan, but there are places which are cheaper. You have to eat at least one bagel if you’re in NYC. Try Zucker’s Bagels or H &amp; H Bagels, but most bodegas (local deli shops) also sell these iconic tasty <a href="##" title="delizie">treats</a>.
Just like bagels, you must also try some NYC pizza. A <a href="##" title="semplice">plain</a> piece (or a regular slice) just has mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce on it and can cost <span class="math inline">\(3 [€2.67] and up. Those are the cheapest slices but check out what else the pizza place has to offer. There’s usually a wide assortment, like pizza with pasta on it, pizza with Buffalo-style chicken (deep fried with a [spicy coating](## &quot;rivestimento piccante&quot;), or try a slice of Sicilian thick-crust pizza. There are also pizza places that offer a [budget](## &quot;economico&quot;) slice for \)</span>1.50 [€1.34] or $2.00 [€1.79] but those usually aren’t that good.
At dinnertime, head over to Koreatown, 32nd Street between 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue, for some inexpensive eats. Look at the menus in the restaurant windows and find a place that has good prices. Bibimbap, a bowl of rice with vegetables and beef, <a href="##" title="guarnire, condire">topped</a> with a fried egg and seasoned with chili paste and sesame, is a good choice. Or you can try Woorijip for super-cheap yet delicious Korean food.
