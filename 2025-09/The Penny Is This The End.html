<p>I costi di produzione di un penny sono più alti del suo valore nominale. Vale la pena continuare a produrre questa moneta? Secondo il presidente Trump, no.</p>

<p>Every day, the US <a href="##" title="zecca">Mint</a> produces about thirty million <a href="##" title="centesimi">pennies</a>, which cost over three times more to produce than they’re <a href="##" title="valere">worth</a>. This year, US President Donald Trump instructed the Department of the Treasury to end the production of the penny. However, it’s not yet clear if the coin will really be <a href="##" title="interrompere, mettere fine">discontinued</a> or not.</p>

<h2 id="heads-or-tails">HEADS OR TAILS?</h2>

<p>The US penny, officially known as ‘the cent’, was first produced in 1787, and has been issued primarily as a copper or <a href="##" title="moneta placcata in rame">copper-plated coin</a>. Since 1909, the year President Abraham Lincoln would have <a href="##" title="compiere gli anni">turned</a> a hundred, the coin has <a href="##" title="presentare">featured</a> President Lincoln’s profile. 
Modern <a href="##" title="centesimi">pennies</a> feature the president’s profile on the <a href="##" title="dritto">obverse</a> (<a href="##" title="testa">heads</a>) of the coin and a Union <a href="##" title="scudo">Shield</a> on the reverse (<a href="##" title="croce">tails</a>.) The thirteen <a href="##" title="strisce">stripes</a> on the shield represent the thirteen original states, and the bar across the top represents Congress and the Federal Government.</p>

<h2 id="expensive-metal">EXPENSIVE METAL</h2>

<p>The penny has been the lowest-value unit of US currency since the half-cent coin was <a href="##" title="interrompere, mettere fine">discontinued</a> in 1857. In the early 2010s, the price of the metal used to make <a href="##" title="centesimi">pennies</a> increased significantly. 
The most recent report from the US <a href="##" title="zecca">Mint</a> says that each penny costs 3.7 cents to make, including three cents for production, and 0.7 cents for administrative and distribution costs. Because of inflation, <a href="##" title="centesimi">pennies</a> have lost practically all their <a href="##" title="potere d’acquisto">purchasing power</a>, and so are often perceived as a <a href="##" title="fastidio, seccatura">nuisance</a> by institutions and people in general. </p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-say">HOW DO YOU SAY&hellip;?</h2>

<p>Un sacco di soldi. 
A pretty penny.</p>

<h2 id="so-wasteful">SO WASTEFUL!</h2>

<p>In February, President Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he had instructed the Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, to end production of the penny, which he described as “so <a href="##" title="inutile">wasteful</a>.” “Let’s <a href="##" title="strappare via">rip the waste out</a> of our great <a href="##" title="bilancio nazionale">nation’s budget</a>, even if it’s <a href="##" title="uno alla volta">a penny at a time</a>,” he wrote. 
The US will not be the first country to eliminate the penny. New Zealand and Australia ended the production of their <a href="##" title="centesimi">pennies</a> back in 1989 and 1992, respectively, and Canada ended production of its penny in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-nickel">WHAT ABOUT THE NICKEL?</h2>

<p>The abolition of the US penny is a <a href="##" title="cosa seria">big deal</a> and will probably require congressional approval. This is because if the US eliminates its penny, it will have to produce more of its second-lowest-value coin: the five-cent coin, or ‘nickel’. But nickels cost even more to produce than <a href="##" title="centesimi">pennies</a>, at 13.8 cents. So, perhaps the US penny is better <a href="##" title="lasciare in pace">left alone</a>, at least for now!  </p>
