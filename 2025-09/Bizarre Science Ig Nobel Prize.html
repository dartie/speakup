<p>Scientific <a href="##" title="risultati scientifici">achievements</a> often amaze or fascinate us. Then there are some, such as the discovery that mammals can potentially breathe through their anuses or that dead <a href="##" title="trota">trout</a> can swim, that are so unexpected, bizarre or <a href="##" title="decisamente">downright</a> <a href="##" title="discutibili">dubious</a> that it makes us laugh <a href="##" title="per l’incredulità">in disbelief</a> and <a href="##" title="con piacere">delight</a>. It is these type of <a href="##" title="risultati scientifici">achievements</a> that are celebrated at the 35th annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts in September. </p>

<h2 id="ignoble-awards">IGNOBLE AWARDS</h2>

<p>Created in 1991, the Ig Nobel (a play on the word ‘<a href="##" title="ignobile">ignoble</a>’) Prize ceremony is organised by the scientific humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research (AIR). It <a href="##" title="premiare">awards</a> ten prizes that “honour <a href="##" title="risultati scientifici">achievements</a> so surprising that they make people LAUGH, then THINK,” according to AIR. The prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honour the imaginative — and <a href="##" title="stimolare">spur</a> people’s interest in science, medicine and technology.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-say">HOW DO YOU SAY&hellip;?</h2>

<p>Rendersi ridicolo.
To make a fool of yourself.</p>

<h2 id="please-stop-i-m-bored">PLEASE STOP, I’M BORED!</h2>

<p>Nobel laureates (mostly) present the <a href="##" title="premiare">awards</a>, which come in the form of <a href="##" title="banconote">banknotes</a> for <a href="##" title="diecimila miliardi">ten trillion</a> Zimbabwean dollars (equivalent to less than 50 cents.) The winners then give a public <a href="##" title="conferenza">lecture</a>. But if they speak for too long, they are interrupted by Miss Sweetie Poo, a little girl who repeatedly shouts “Please stop, I’m bored!” This is one of several eccentric traditions at the ceremony, which concludes with the announcement “If you didn’t win a prize — and especially if you did — better luck next year!”</p>

<h2 id="past-winners">PAST WINNERS </h2>

<p>One of the most famous winners of the satirical science award is Sir Andre Geim, who is the only person ever to have won an Ig Nobel Prize and a Nobel Prize. He won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2000 for levitating a <a href="##" title="rana">frog</a> by magnetism, and a Nobel Prize in 2010 for his work on the electromagnetic properties of graphene. The work of fictional scientists has also been honoured. 
Real-life past winners include Michigan-based televangelists Jack and Rexella Van Impe, for their <a href="##" title="dichiarazione">claim</a> that black holes meet all the technical requirements to be the location of hell; British <a href="##" title="allevatori di pollame">poultry farmers</a>, for their discovery that <a href="##" title="struzzi">ostriches</a> are sexually attracted to humans; and high-school student Jillian Clarke for her research exploring the belief that food <a href="##" title="cadere">dropped</a> on the floor can be safely eaten if picked up within five seconds — a belief colloquially known as the ‘Five-Second Rule’.
