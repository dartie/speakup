# The Penny: Is This The End?   [B1]

I costi di produzione di un penny sono più alti del suo valore nominale. Vale la pena continuare a produrre questa moneta? Secondo il presidente Trump, no.

Every day, the US [Mint](## "zecca") produces about thirty million [pennies](## "centesimi"), which cost over three times more to produce than they’re [worth](## "valere"). This year, US President Donald Trump instructed the Department of the Treasury to end the production of the penny. However, it’s not yet clear if the coin will really be [discontinued](## "interrompere, mettere fine") or not.

## HEADS OR TAILS?
The US penny, officially known as ‘the cent’, was first produced in 1787, and has been issued primarily as a copper or [copper-plated coin](## "moneta placcata in rame"). Since 1909, the year President Abraham Lincoln would have [turned](## "compiere gli anni") a hundred, the coin has [featured](## "presentare") President Lincoln’s profile. 
Modern [pennies](## "centesimi") feature the president’s profile on the [obverse](## "dritto") ([heads](## "testa")) of the coin and a Union [Shield](## "scudo") on the reverse ([tails](## "croce").) The thirteen [stripes](## "strisce") on the shield represent the thirteen original states, and the bar across the top represents Congress and the Federal Government.

## EXPENSIVE METAL
The penny has been the lowest-value unit of US currency since the half-cent coin was [discontinued](## "interrompere, mettere fine") in 1857. In the early 2010s, the price of the metal used to make [pennies](## "centesimi") increased significantly. 
The most recent report from the US [Mint](## "zecca") says that each penny costs 3.7 cents to make, including three cents for production, and 0.7 cents for administrative and distribution costs. Because of inflation, [pennies](## "centesimi") have lost practically all their [purchasing power](## "potere d’acquisto"), and so are often perceived as a [nuisance](## "fastidio, seccatura") by institutions and people in general. 

## HOW DO YOU SAY...?
Un sacco di soldi. 
A pretty penny.

## SO WASTEFUL!
In February, President Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he had instructed the Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, to end production of the penny, which he described as “so [wasteful](## "inutile").” “Let’s [rip the waste out](## "strappare via") of our great [nation’s budget](## "bilancio nazionale"), even if it’s [a penny at a time](## "uno alla volta"),” he wrote. 
The US will not be the first country to eliminate the penny. New Zealand and Australia ended the production of their [pennies](## "centesimi") back in 1989 and 1992, respectively, and Canada ended production of its penny in 2012.

## WHAT ABOUT THE NICKEL?
The abolition of the US penny is a [big deal](## "cosa seria") and will probably require congressional approval. This is because if the US eliminates its penny, it will have to produce more of its second-lowest-value coin: the five-cent coin, or ‘nickel’. But nickels cost even more to produce than [pennies](## "centesimi"), at 13.8 cents. So, perhaps the US penny is better [left alone](## "lasciare in pace"), at least for now!
