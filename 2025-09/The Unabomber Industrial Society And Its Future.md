The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the [life expectancy](## "aspettativa di vita") of those of us who live in ‘advanced’ countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life [unfulfilling](## "insoddisfacente"), have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to [widespread](## "generalizzata") psychological suffering […] and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world.” These were the words that [shook](## "scuotere") America on the morning of 19 September 1995. On the recommendation of the FBI, The Washington Post agreed to publish the Unabomber’s manifesto, after he [vowed](## "promettere") to pause his seventeen-year-long campaign of terror if his message was made public. 

## BESTSELLER
The decision to publish the essay proved crucial in solving the case — but it also [served the terrorist’s purposes](## "fare gli interessi"). In the thirty years since its publication, “Industrial Society and Its Future” has acquired a kind of cult-like status. The manifesto, which [sold out](## "esaurire") at [newsstands](## "edicole") that Tuesday thirty years ago, has remained controversial. In fact, as time has passed, some of its [tenets](## "principi, dogmi") have proven insightful. Reprinted by various small publishing houses, it still ranks among the top five bestsellers listed on Amazon under the category of Radical Political Thought. 
Frequently cited by critics of technological society and studied by scholars worldwide, its [core](## "centrali") ideas about the [harms](## "danni") [brought on](## "causare, provocare") by our dependence on technology and the rise of technocracy, alongside its [endorsement](## "appoggio, sostegno") of environmental extremism, seem [prescient](## "preveggente, premonitore"). In an age defined by climate catastrophes, [mass surveillance](## "sorveglianza di massa"), the toxic influence of social media and the [looming](## "incombente") menace of artificial intelligence, Kaczynski [foresaw](## "prevedere") a world where algorithms increasingly govern how we live and the choices we make.

## DANGEROUS INSPIRATION
“Industrial Society and Its Future” is one of those rare texts cited by both the radical right and the radical left. Tragically, it has also inspired other acts of terror: Norwegian white supremacist Anders Brevik, who killed seventy-seven people in 2011, quoted Kaczynski in his own manifesto; while more recently, Luigi Mangione, the accused shooter of [insurance executive](## "dirigente assicurativo") Brian Thompson, wrote in an online review that “It’s simply impossible to ignore how [prescient](## "preveggente, premonitore") many of his predictions about modern society [turned out](## "risultare").”

## #TEDPILL
Over time, the Unabomber Manifesto has become a [vortex](## "vortice") of ideas that [echo](## "risuonare") through a range of [fringe](## "marginali, estremiste") ideologies: from neo-Luddism to far-right populism, survivalism to eco-fascism. Paradoxically, Kaczynski’s controversial legacy has been [embraced](## "abbracciare, accogliere") by some gurus of Silicon Valley libertarianism, and he has been [praised](## "elogiare") by [the likes of](## "gente come, del calibro di") Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. In recent years, the manifesto has been the subject of the post-ironic treatment typical of the internet and its ideas have spread on social platforms, such as X and TikTok under the hashtag #Tedpill — a label used to idealise a return to pre-industrial life through viral content and memes.
