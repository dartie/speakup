# The Dodo Bird: Back from Extinction   [A2]

Estinto da ben quattro secoli, questo pennuto dal nome divertente potrebbe resuscitare, secondo un progetto scientifico che sta sollevando qualche polemica.

The dodo was a [large](## "grande") [plump](## "paffuto") bird with a friendly temperament that through evolution had lost the ability to fly. According to historical [accounts](## "testimonianze"), it was bigger than a [turkey](## "tacchino") and could reach a body weight of more than twenty kilograms. It had  blue-grey plumage, a long [hooked](## "a uncino") [beak](## "becco") and [tiny](## "piccole, minuscole") wings. 

## extinCTION
Dodos became extinct nearly four hundred years ago. They were once endemic to Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean where no natural predators [threatened](## "minacciare") their existence. However, in the late 16th century [Dutch](## "olandesi") [sailors](## "marinai") arrived on the island. They [hunted](## "cacciare") the docile bird, and brought animals with them, including dogs, cats, pigs and monkeys as well as rats from the ships, which destroyed the [ground nests](## "nidi a terra") and ate the eggs. By the late 17th century dodos were extinct.

## bringing back the dodo
This year the US startup Colossal Biosciences announced plans to bring back or ‘de-extinct’ the dodo. [So far](## "finora"), they have raised $150 million to finance the project. The scientific team has already managed to sequence the DNA of a dodo, but once the genome is fully decoded, they must [figure out](## "escogitare") a way to put the dodo genes into the embryo of a living animal. Some scientists think that the Nicobar [pigeon](## "piccione"), the [closest](## "più vicino") living [relative](## "parente") of the dodo, could have its DNA modified to include some dodo DNA. This means that, hypothetically, when these [pigeon](## "piccione") eggs [hatch](## "schiudersi"), a recreated version of the dodo will be born.

## NOT 100 PER CENT DODO
Some years ago, Colossal Biosciences announced a similar project to revive both the [woolly mammoth](## "mammut lanoso") and the Tasmanian tiger, other lost species. However, the dodo is more [challenging](## "impegnativo") as less genomic research has been [performed](## "eseguire") on birds than on [mammals](## "mammiferi"). Will the revived dodo be identical to the original? We will never know. 

## Ethical questions
In addition to the scientific challenge, the project [raises serious ethical questions](## "sollevare una questione"). Do experiments such as this [channel](## "convogliare") money and attention away from efforts to save the world’s living [endangered](## "a rischio di estinzione") species? Why [focus](## "concentrarsi") on certain charismatic animals over others? [Moreover](## "inoltre"), where would these revived species live? How could they adapt to today’s [environment](## "ambiente")? Who could teach a de-extinct dodo to live and [behave](## "comportarsi") like its [long lost](## "scomparsi da tempo") ancestors?
