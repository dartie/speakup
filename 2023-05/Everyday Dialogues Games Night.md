**Oliver:** I’m [looking forward to](## "non vedere l’ora di") games night! It will be nice to catch up with the gang.
**Sophie:** Yes! But can we do something else? I always lose at poker and I’m [broke](## "senza soldi").
**Oliver: **Sure, what did you have in mind?
**Sophie: **I don’t know. What about an [old-fashioned](## "vecchio stile") [board game](## "gioco da tavolo")?
**Oliver: **What, like Trivial [Pursuit](## "ricerca") or Monopoly?
**Sophie: **Exactly! Or something even more traditional, like [chess](## "scacchi") or checkers.
**Oliver: **Oh, I haven’t played those for years. Do you think the others would be up for it?
**Sophie: **For sure! But I’m not sure if everyone knows how to play.
**Oliver: **Also, they’re one-on-one. It might be best to stick to a game we can all play together.
**Sophie: **Yes, that makes sense.
**Oliver: **It doesn’t need to be a [board game](## "gioco da tavolo"), either. We could play charades!
**Sophie: **Nooooo, that’s so lame!
**Oliver: **Okay, okay, I’ll get the games out, then we can choose one on the night.
