# Mount Everest: Reaching the Summit   [B2]

Il 29 maggio del 1953 gli alpinisti Edmund Hillary, neozelandese, e l’indo-nepalese Tenzing Norgay furono i primi scalatori a raggiungere la cima più alta della Terra. Una prodezza che molti cercano di emulare.

Everest, at 8,849 metres [above](## "sopra") sea level, is the highest mountain in the world. It [sits](## "trovarsi") on the [crest](## "cima") of the Himalayas on the [border](## "frontiera") between Nepal and Tibet. Called Chomo-Lungma, or ‘Mother Goddess of the Land’, by the Tibetans, the English named the mountain after Sir George Everest, a 19th-century [surveyor](## "topografo"). The [summit](## "cima, vetta") of Everest reaches two-thirds of the way through the Earth’s atmosphere, almost the cruising [altitude](## "altitudine di crociera") of a commercial flight.

## death at the SUMMIT? 
The first recorded [attempt](## "tentativo") to [climb](## "scalare") Everest was made in 1921 by a British expedition. A violent storm forced them to abort. Brilliant mountaineer George Mallory returned in 1924 with another British expedition. They reached an elevation of 8,573 metres without using artificial oxygen. Mallory and [fellow](## "compagno, collega") mountaineer Andrew Irvine [attempt](## "tentativo")ed the [summit](## "cima, vetta"), and did not return. In 1999, Mallory’s frozen body was miraculously [recovered](## "recuperare"). [Whether](## "se") he or Irvine reached the [summit](## "cima, vetta") remains a mystery.

## KHUMBU ICEFALL
In April 1953, New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepali-Indian Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were part of another British team that planned to scale the southeast face of Everest. They made their first camp [below](## "sotto") the Khumbu [Icefall](## "cascata di ghiaccio"), a [steep](## "ripida"), [rugged](## "impervia, scoscesa"), rapidly-moving section of the Khumbu Glacier. Here, constant movement opens deep [crevasses](## "crepacci") and sends [chunks](## "blocchi") of ice [hurtling](## "precipitare") down the mountain. After successfully crossing the icefall, the team walked up the Western [Cwm](## "valle (in gallese)"), a glacial valley with [steep](## "ripida") [ridges](## "creste") around it. It leads to the south face of Lhotse, the fourth highest mountain in the world.

## THE DEATH ZONE
Typically, the last camp on an Everest ascent is made at the South [Col](## "colle"), 7,920 metres up. This [dip](## "avvallamento") between two peaks is swept clear of snow by high winds However, Hillary and Tenzing went up another 610 meters. They were now in the ‘death zone’, an area so called because there is not enough oxygen for humans to survive. On the final five-hour [climb](## "scalare"), Hillary and Tenzing fought through snow, followed an exposed [ridgeline](## "crinale, costone") with 1,000-metre [drops](## "cadute"), [scrambled](## "arrampicarsi") up [steep](## "ripida"), rocky steps, and finally crossed a [sloping](## "inclinato") snowfield to reach the [summit](## "cima, vetta") of Everest at 11:30am on 29 May 1953. 

## SUMMIT FEVER
Since then, there have been approximately 11,346 [summit](## "cima, vetta") ascents by 6,098 people. whereas over 310 [climb](## "scalare")ers have died while [attempt](## "tentativo")ing to ascend or more commonly on the descent. The major causes of death are avalanches, falls and [collapses](## "collassi") due to [altitude](## "altitudine di crociera") sickness. In the death zone the body’s cells begin to die and lungs and brains fill with liquid. 

## DEADLY CONGESTION
Major tragedies occurred in 1996 when a [blizzard](## "tormenta di neve") hit, killing twelve [climb](## "scalare")ers; in 2014 an avalanche killed sixteen; and in 2015 a devastating earthquake that killed around nine thousand people caused avalanches in which twenty-two [climb](## "scalare")ers died. There are also modern dangers on the mountain: commercialisation has led to less experienced [climb](## "scalare")ers and congestion. People can be trapped for hours in the death zone, [queuing](## "fare la coda") for an opportunity to reach the [summit](## "cima, vetta"). Climbers report seeing frozen bodies, from days to decades old, all along the route.
Culture
Scalare le cime dell'Everest fino al Campo Base non è una missione facile, ma ne vale la pena per i panorami mozzafiato e i posti storici. Jeff Bonaldi, viaggiatore e fondatore di "The Explorer’s Passage", ci racconta la sua avventura.
