<p><strong>Oliver:</strong> I’m <a href="##" title="non vedere l’ora di">looking forward to</a> games night! It will be nice to catch up with the gang.
<strong>Sophie:</strong> Yes! But can we do something else? I always lose at poker and I’m <a href="##" title="senza soldi">broke</a>.
**Oliver: **Sure, what did you have in mind?
**Sophie: **I don’t know. What about an <a href="##" title="vecchio stile">old-fashioned</a> <a href="##" title="gioco da tavolo">board game</a>?
**Oliver: **What, like Trivial <a href="##" title="ricerca">Pursuit</a> or Monopoly?
**Sophie: **Exactly! Or something even more traditional, like <a href="##" title="scacchi">chess</a> or checkers.
**Oliver: **Oh, I haven’t played those for years. Do you think the others would be up for it?
**Sophie: **For sure! But I’m not sure if everyone knows how to play.
**Oliver: **Also, they’re one-on-one. It might be best to stick to a game we can all play together.
**Sophie: **Yes, that makes sense.
**Oliver: **It doesn’t need to be a <a href="##" title="gioco da tavolo">board game</a>, either. We could play charades!
**Sophie: **Nooooo, that’s so lame!
**Oliver: **Okay, okay, I’ll get the games out, then we can choose one on the night.</p>
