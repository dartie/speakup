If you buy fresh [cherries](## "ciliegie") [while in](## "mentre sei in") England, there’s a strong possibility that they were [grown](## "coltivare") in Kent. This beautiful South East [county](## "contea") is known as ‘the Garden of England’. It has the warmest climate in Britain, and its fertile agricultural land and country [estates](## "tenute, residenze") grow a variety of fruit, vegetables, flowers, herbs and other plants.

## 2.4 million bottles of wine 
Kent is a big [produce](## "prodotti agricoli")r of English wine, beer and [spirits](## "bevande alcoliche") such as gin and vodka. The [county](## "contea") has many award-winning [wineries](## "enoteche, cantine") and [vineyards](## "vigneti"), including the country’s largest, Chapel Down. Based in the picturesque market town of Tenterden, Chapel Down has over 950 acres dedicated to [grape](## "uva") growing and [produce](## "prodotti agricoli")s up to 2.4 million bottles of white, [sparkling](## "frizzante") and [rosé wine](## "vino rosé") a year. Like many other [vineyards](## "vigneti") in Kent, it is open to the public for seasonal tours and wine [tastings.](## "degustazioni")

## [hops](## "luppolo") and pubs
The cathedral city of Canterbury was the first place that [hops](## "luppolo") (the plants used in [brewing](## "preparare, fermentare") beer) were [grown](## "coltivare") in England, in around 1520. Today, you can visit historic [oast houses](## "essiccatoi per il luppolo") where the [hops](## "luppolo") were [dried](## "seccare"). Some of them are now pubs, while others have been converted into private homes. Visit some of the [county](## "contea")’s one hundred and eleven [breweries](## "fabbriche di birra") to try the huge variety of local beer. 

## GLASS OF WINE, SIR!
Celebrated author Charles Dickens had a love-hate relationship with the English [county](## "contea") of Kent. In his 1837 novel The Pickwick Papers characters alternate between genuinely admiring the [county](## "contea")’s history and landscape, and savagely satirising its inhabitants. “Kent, Sir — everybody knows Kent — apples, [cherries](## "ciliegie"), [hops](## "luppolo"), and women. Glass of wine, Sir!”. Known as the Garden of England, this historic [county](## "contea") in the South East [boasts](## "vantarsi") picturesque countryside, [quaint](## "pittoreschi, caratteristici") rural villages, a [dramatic](## "spettacolare") coastline and a rich [heritage](## "spettacolare"). To find out more, we spoke to Yvonne Leach. A long-time resident, Leach gives private tours in which she shares her expertise on Kent’s history and present. We began by asking Leach what it was that so fascinated Dickens and herself about the [county](## "contea"). 
**Yvonne Leach (English accent): **I always think of it as being two things. It’s where England begins. We’re 21 miles from the rest of Continental Europe. You stand on the [cliffs](## "scogliere") and you can see France. [With] binoculars, you can see the time on the clock tower in Calais. So we’re very near to Continental Europe. So we’ve got this wonderful [heritage](## "spettacolare") and history of everyone coming: the Romans, the Saxons, and Normans... All have come to this part. But then we’ve got this wonderful countryside and farmland and [rolling hills](## "dolci colline") and so many [stately homes](## "residenze signorili") and castles.

## THE BELGIAN CONNECTION
And as Leach explained, Kent owes its reputation as the Garden of England to its relationship with its European neighbours. 
**Yvonne Leach:** It’s many hundreds of years ago. Some people say it goes back to the time of at least our first Protestant Queen, Elizabeth I. She gave sanctuary to a lot of immigrants that were coming from — I suppose we’d now say Belgium and Holland, the Low Countries. And they helped us with fruit production. [Thank goodness](## "grazie al cielo") for them! We’ve got these lovely [cherries](## "ciliegie") here, for example. And because of our geographic situation, we’re near enough to London to get fruit to the court. We’ve got a good climate, we’ve got a good terrain. It’s ideal for growing.

## SPARKLING AND STILL
Kent [boasts](## "vantarsi") beautiful country [estates](## "tenute, residenze"), landscape gardens and extensive [vineyards](## "vigneti"). Leach tells us more. 
**Yvonne Leach:** There are beautiful gardens — Sissinghurst, for example —, various castles: Hever Castle, and where Sir Winston Churchill lived, Chartwell, is here — beautiful grounds! Penshurst Place, lots of gardens and castles and [stately homes](## "residenze signorili"). But the [vineyards](## "vigneti")... when I first [trained](## "formarsi professionalmente") we had about two [vineyards](## "vigneti"). And now nearly every town and village has a vineyard, and they’re award-winning: [sparkling](## "frizzante") wines, red wines now... And the tasting is great fun. And then try the local [produce](## "prodotti agricoli") as well, with the wines.

## OYSTERS!
We then asked Leach to recommend her favourite local products.
**Yvonne Leach:** We also have Whitstable, which is not very far from Canterbury, and that’s famous for its [oysters](## "ostriche"). That was the original place that s[tart](## "tortino")ed the [oysters](## "ostriche") that went up to London in [wheelers](## "carri trainati da cavalli"). So [oysters](## "ostriche"), seafood. We have the [marshes](## "paludi"), which have their own [breed of sheep](## "razza ovina"), the Romney [marsh lamb](## "agnello delle paludi"). So at certain times of the year, the pubs will [advertise](## "fare pubblicità") that they’re selling Romney [marsh lamb](## "agnello delle paludi"), which is a speciality. And something that’s quite interesting, you love it or hate it, it’s a particular kind of [tart](## "tortino") called ‘[gypsy](## "gitano") [tart](## "tortino")’. And it was invented by a lady who felt sorry for the local gypsies. So she [came up](## "escogitare") with this thing that had all things that are good for you in there: lots of sugar and cream, one thing or another... and eggs. And she [fed](## "dar da mangiare") that to the local [gypsy](## "gitano") children.

## THE WHITE CLIFFS
There are many beautiful spots in the [county](## "contea") but one is [deservedly](## "meritatamente") world-famous, says Leach. 
**Yvonne Leach:** There are two things. One is not perhaps so much the garden, but it is standing up on the White Cliffs of Dover. Looking out and it [brings home](## "rendere chiaro") the recognition of the fact that we are an island, but how close we are to France. And my local town is Sandwich, and I love Sandwich: medieval, the character, the houses... But you’ve also got all around you those [orchards](## "frutteti") and [hops](## "luppolo") and things like that. And in the middle of Kent as well, a bit further away from me, are [rolling hills](## "dolci colline"), and you can go for miles and just enjoy the countryside.
