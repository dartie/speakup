<p>Frank Sinatra’s <a href="##" title="canzone simbolo">signature song</a> My Way began life as European hit Comme d’habitude (As Usual), a 1967 <a href="##" title="separazione">break-up</a> song by French superstar Claude François, to music by Jacques Revaux. Canadian singer-songwriter Paul Anka heard the song while <a href="##" title="essere in vacanza">holidaying</a> in Paris and acquired its rights. A few months on he had dinner with Sinatra in Florida. The music legend, then in his <a href="##" title="sulla cinquantina">early fifties</a>, announced that he was considering <a href="##" title="pensionamento">retirement</a>, <a href="##" title="a quanto pare">reportedly</a> telling Anka: &ldquo;<a href="##" title="lasciare">I’m quitting</a> the business. I’m <a href="##" title="stufo">sick</a> of it, I’m <a href="##" title="andarsene">getting the hell out</a>.” This inspired Anka to <a href="##" title="stare sveglio">stay up</a> all night adapting François’ track about the death of love through routine into a celebratory <a href="##" title="canto del cigno">swan song</a> for Sinatra. He did so by asking himself, “If Frank were writing this, what would he say?”. The result was recorded by Sinatra in just <a href="##" title="registrazione">one take</a> on 30 December 1968.
In fact, a different English version of the song already existed. Revaux had sent his melody to London, looking for someone to adapt it into an English-language song. A young David Bowie wrote and recorded a <a href="##" title="dimostrazione audio">demo,</a> but it was rejected.
In My Way, Sinatra looks back on his life and all its <a href="##" title="alti e bassi">ups and downs</a>. He declares <a href="##" title="orgoglio">pride</a> in taking responsibility for all the decisions that he has made. My Way has spent more time on the UK <a href="##" title="classifiche">charts</a> than any other song (124 weeks), and Elvis Presley’s live recording of the song was <a href="##" title="pubblicare">released</a> in the weeks after his death. Other cover versions include those by Aretha Franklin and by Sid Vicious of The Sex Pistols. Donald Trump chose My Way as his first dance at his 2017 presidential inauguration, and it is also extremely popular at funerals. <a href="##" title="malgrado">Despite</a> its phenomenal success, Sinatra disliked the song, calling it “<a href="##" title="egoista">self-serving</a> and self-indulgent”. 
<strong>My Way</strong>
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I’ll say it clear
I’ll <a href="##" title="state my case: this means to express your opinion and present the evidence in your favour, as if on a trial.">state my case</a>, of which I’m <a href="##" title="sicuro">certain</a>
I’ve lived a life that’s full
I travelled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
<a href="##">Regrets</a>, I’ve had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each <a href="##" title="percorso tracciato">charted course</a>
Each careful step along the <a href="##" title="strada secondaria">byway</a>
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes, there were times, I’m sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I <a href="##" title="mangiare">ate it up</a> and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way
I’ve loved, I’ve laughed and cried
I’ve had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears <a href="##" title="placarsi">subside</a>
I find it all so <a href="##" title="divertente">amusing</a>
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a <a href="##" title="timida">shy</a> way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he <a href="##" title="davvero">truly</a> feels
And not the words of one who <a href="##" title="inginocchiarsi">kneels</a>
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way
