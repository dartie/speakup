**Thomas:** Happy New Year!
**Emily:** Happy New Year to you, too! [Shall we](## "ti va di...?") go for a drink or a bite to eat?
**Thomas: **Let’s go for a coffee and a sandwich. I’m giving up alcohol [for a while](## "per un po’").
**Emily: **Oh, new year’s resolution, is it?
**Thomas: **Yes, exactly. I’m laying off the booze and taking up running. Got to get in shape.
**Emily: **[Well done, you](## "complimenti, bravo")! I’m giving up smoking myself.
**Thomas: **Hey, that’s great! I was [wondering](## "domandarsi") why you hadn’t nipped outside yet.
**Emily: **Yes, well, it’s not easy. I’m having quite a hard time of it, [actually](## "in realtà").
**Thomas: **I’m sure. It’s one of the hardest things I’ve done myself, but I feel all the better for it — especially when I run.
**Emily: **Yes, maybe I should [join](## "unirsi") you!
**Thomas: **That’d be great! It’s really boring by myself. I go before breakfast around 6am.
**Emily: **Ugh, perhaps not then. I hate [early mornings](## "svegliarsi presto")…
