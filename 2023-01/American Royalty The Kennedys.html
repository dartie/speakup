<p>Il fascino di questa potente famiglia irlandese dal sangue blu ha sedotto l’opinione pubblica americana per decenni. L’influenza di questo tragico clan si sente ancora in numerosi aspetti della vita sociale e politica degli Stati Uniti.</p>

<p>For more than half a century the Kennedy family were considered the <a href="##" title="più vicino, più simile">closest</a> thing America had to <a href="##" title="famiglia reale">royalty</a>. Its members who elected to <a href="##" title="incarico pubblico">public office</a> — most notably John F. Kennedy, elected as US President in 1961 — all served as Democrats, while others worked for the Democratic Party in an <a href="##" title="serie, varietà">array</a> of roles. Famed for their <a href="##" title="sostegno">championing</a> of social justice in America, the Kennedys were also <a href="##" title="sfortunatamente conosciuti per">notorious</a> for their infidelities and rebellious <a href="##" title="comportamento">behaviour</a>.</p>

<h2 id="irish-heritage-eredità">irish <a href="##" title="eredità">heritage</a></h2>

<p>The Kennedy <a href="##" title="eredità">heritage</a> has been <a href="##" title="far risalire">traced back</a> to Ceineidi, 10th-century king of North Munster, southwest Ireland. The <a href="##" title="regno">kingdom</a> of Munster was one of the ancient <a href="##" title="regno">kingdom</a>s of Gaelic Ireland until it was <a href="##" title="dividere, disintegrare">broken up</a> in 1118. Over the centuries, the O’Kennedy family lost their royal status, but remained powerful Irish Catholic <a href="##" title="proprietari di terre">landowners</a>. That was until the 17th century, when their land was confiscated by the English invaders. With the Irish ‘O’ ordered to be <a href="##" title="togliere, abbandonare, rinunciare">dropped</a> from their surname, the Kennedys became <a href="##" title="commercianti">traders</a> in County Wexford.  In the 19th century, <a href="##" title="generalizzata">widespread</a> poverty in Ireland <a href="##" title="spingere, portare a">drove</a> Patrick Joseph Kennedy to emigrate to the US. In 1849, he found work in Boston as a <a href="##" title="fabbricante di barili">barrel maker</a>, but then died of cholera. His son Patrick “P. J.” Kennedy went into business and served in the Massachusetts <a href="##" title="legislatura statale (organo del potere legislativo di ogni stato dell’Unione)">state legislature</a>. P. J.’s son Joseph (“Joe”) made a fortune in banking. He worked in various positions in government, and was <a href="##" title="nominare">appointed</a> US ambassador to the UK <a href="##" title="in vista dell’arrivo di">in the lead-up to</a> World War Two.</p>

<h2 id="tragic-decade">TRAGIC DECADE</h2>

<p>Joe and his wife Rose, a prominent socialite, had nine kids, many better known by their <a href="##" title="nomignoli">nicknames</a>: Joseph Jr., John (“Jack”), Rose Marie (“Rosemary”), Kathleen (“Kick”), Eunice, Patricia, Robert (“Bobby”), Jean, and Edward (“Ted”). The 1940s were difficult years for the family: the <a href="##" title="maggiore">eldest</a>, Joseph Jr., died when his warplane exploded; Rosemary had violent <a href="##" title="cambi di umore, alti e bassi emozionali">mood swings</a> and was given a pre-frontal lobotomy which left her permanently incapacitated; Kick scandalised the family by <a href="##" title="fuggire per sposarsi">eloping</a> to England with a Protestant aristocrat, and soon afterwards was killed in a plane crash. </p>

<h2 id="the-kennedy-curse">THE KENNEDY CURSE</h2>

<p>In the 1950s family members began <a href="##" title="salire al potere">to climb the political ladder</a>. However, the 1960s were a traumatic decade for them: after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, and that of his brother, Senator Robert Kennedy, in 1968, rumours spread of a “Kennedy <a href="##" title="maledizione">curse</a>”. Nevertheless, the Kennedys were certainly privileged: when Ted <a href="##" title="schiantarsi contro, andare a finire dentro"><a href="##" title="spingere, portare a">drove</a> his car into</a> a lake in 1969, killing the young woman who he was travelling with, he still <a href="##" title="riuscire">managed</a><strong> </strong>to become a universally-respected US senator, and <a href="##" title="rimase tale">remained so</a> for forty-seven years afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="younger-generations">YOUNGER GENERATIONS</h2>

<p>In later generations, the power of the Kennedys has declined and there have been many well-publicised tragedies. Bobby’s son David died of a drug overdose in 1984, and Michael died in a skiing accident in 1997. Jack’s son John Jr. died in yet another plane crash. Ted’s daughter Kara and Patricia’s son Christopher both died of heart attacks when they were <a href="##" title="di mezza età">middle aged</a>. More recently, Bobby’s granddaughter Saoirse died of a drug overdose, while his granddaughter Maeve <a href="##" title="affogare">drowned</a>. There are, however, younger Kennedys who have followed in the family <a href="##" title="seguire le orme">footsteps</a> and been successful in US politics: Bobby’s grandson Joe III served in Congress, and the late-President’s daughter Caroline Kennedy is the current US ambassador to Australia.</p>
