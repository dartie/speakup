# A Floating Palace: The Royal Yacht "Britannia"   [B2]

Per quasi cinque decenni lo yacht Britannia è stato il palazzo galleggiante e il mezzo di trasporto preferito della regina Elisabetta II e di suo marito, il duca di Edimburgo. Attualmente questa nave è un’importante attrazione turistica ormeggiata a Leith, vicino alla capitale scozzese.

On 16 April 1953, Queen Elizabeth II began her relationship with probably her favourite home with the words, “I name this ship Britannia. I wish success to her and to all who [sail](## "navigare") in her.” Forty-four years later, on 11 December 1997, when the Queen [stepped ashore](## "sbarcare") from the Royal [Yacht](## "yacht") Britannia after her final trip, her normal composure left her and she [shed a tear](## "piangere lacrime"). The exact moment — 3:01pm — is [displayed](## "esporre") on all the ship’s clocks.

## a royal necessity
At the ship’s [launch](## "varo"), the Queen explained the need for a Royal [Yacht](## "yacht"), the 83rd in the Royal Family’s history. She felt “that a yacht was a necessity and not a luxury for the Head of our great British Commonwealth between whose countries the sea is no barrier, but the natural and indestructible [highway](## "autostrada").”

## One Million Miles
Britannia spent forty-four years in the service of Britain and the Commonwealth, making almost a thousand official visits. It [sail](## "navigare")ed more than one million miles and [called at more than six hundred ports](## "fare scalo in un porto") in 135 countries. It served as a [means](## "mezzo") of transport, a [theatre of state](## "scenario nel quale vengono prese decisioni politiche") and a home.

## Palace at Sea
The Queen and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh (a naval officer), participated in the ship’s design and decoration. So the royal apartment was a clear guide to the couple’s interests and tastes. The Queen’s bedroom had a modest single bed, but the [dated back](## "risalire") [linen](## "biancheria") to Queen Victoria! 
Britannia was over 125 metres long. The Queen’s royal apartment occupied one-third of the ship. The rest was a working Royal Navy [vessel](## "nave, barca"), although the ship was really a floating palace, with even telephones identical to those in Buckingham Palace. The [crew](## "equipaggio") numbered 220 under the command of twenty-one officers, and included a Royal Marine band.

## Specific Ship Rules 
Britannia had its own specific rules. To avoid excessive noise, the [crew](## "equipaggio") wore [gym shoes](## "scarpe sportive"), and there was no [tannoy](## "megafono") system or [shouting](## "grida") — telephones and hand signals were used to communicate orders. The yacht also had a garage for the Queen’s Phantom V Rolls Royce, but [bumpers](## "paraurti") had to be removed to permit the car to [fit](## "avere lo spazio sufficiente").

## Time for Retirement
By the late 1990s, Britannia was showing its age. On June 30, 1997, it performed its final state role in the [handover](## "restituzione") of Hong Kong to China. It returned to Britain to be [decommissioned](## "smantellare") at Portsmouth. In line with its long, illustrious career, the world-famous ship was allowed a dignified retirement. Britannia [sail](## "navigare")ed into the tourist world and can now be visited in Edinburgh as Scotland’s most popular tourist attraction. More than 350,000 people visit the iconic ship every year.
