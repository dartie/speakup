# The Final Journey: Bobby Kennedy   [B2]

Nel giugno del 1968, un treno di ventuno carrozze portò la salma di Robert F. Kennedy da New York a Washington. Pochi giorni prima era stato assassinato. Lungo i 360 chilometri di tragitto, folle di migliaia di cittadini diedero l’ultimo addio a un politico considerato portavoce delle minoranze più svantaggiate.

Robert Francis Kennedy is perhaps less well-known than John Fitzgerald Kennedy, US president from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. However, ask any American over sixty where they were on 8 June 1968, and they will tell you. 

## us attorney general
Born in 1925, Robert, better-known as Bobby, was the seventh of nine children of the prominent political Kennedy family. As a lawyer, he fought organised crime and earned a reputation as an [uncompromising](## "inflessibile, incorruttibile") [prosecutor](## "procuratore"). With his older brother in the White House, Bobby was [appointed](## "nominare") US [Attorney General](## "procuratore generale"). He served as the President’s closest [advisor](## "consigliere"), taking part in major decisions, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the resolution of which [averted](## "evitare") nuclear war with the USSR.

## CIVIL RIGHTS
After John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Bobby discarded the [tough](## "dura, fredda") image he had cultivated and began to advocate for issues related to civil rights and social justice. He opposed US [involvement](## "coinvolgimento") in the Vietnam War and [raised awareness](## "sensibilizzare") of poverty in the country, [sponsoring](## "proporre") legislation to bring businesses to impoverished communities. 

## BOBBY FOR PRESIDENT
In 1968, Bobby took the risky step of [challenging](## "sfidare") Lyndon Johnson, the [incumbent](## "incarica") president of his own party, the Democrats. New York Senator at the time, Bobby became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, [appealing](## "attrarre") to poor, African-American, Hispanic and young voters. When Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in April 1968, Bobby asked King’s followers not to respond with [hatred](## "odio"), and his empathy earned their respect. 

## SHOT IN ACTION
On 5 June 1968, just after winning the California primary, Kennedy was shot three times [at close range](## "da vicino") at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, and died a day later. The shooter was twenty-four-year-old Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan, in [alleged](## "presunta") [retaliation](## "rappresaglia") for Kennedy’s support of Israel. But Bobby’s assassination, like that of his brother, continues to be the subject of controversy.

## THE FUNERAL TRAIN
On 8 June 1968, after his funeral in New York, the body of the senator was taken by train to Washington D.C. destined for [burial](## "sepoltura") at Arlington National Cemetery. The journey usually took four hours, but the train travelled at half the speed because hundreds of thousands of people had [gathered](## "riunirsi") on [station platforms](## "corsie") and [by the tracks](## "lungo le vie"). The photographer Paul Fusco was among the passengers on the train. The pictures he took, compiled in a book published in 2000, stand as a testament to the human impact of a world-changing event.
