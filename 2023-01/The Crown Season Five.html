<p>Season five of The Crown is now streaming on Netflix and, <a href="##" title="come era da aspettarsi">as expected</a>, it has <a href="##" title="invadere, inondare">taken the internet by storm</a>. Reviews are divisive: heavy criticism on the one hand and <a href="##" title="eccezionale">outstanding</a> <a href="##" title="lode">praise</a> on the other. Historical <a href="##" title="casualità, coincidenza">happenstance</a> has <a href="##" title="anticipare">preempted</a> the arrival of this fifth fictional <a href="##" title="stagione">instalment</a>; with King Charles III recently ascended to the throne after the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II, the debate over the purpose of the British monarchy is <a href="##" title="diventare rilevante">gaining traction</a> once again. 
This season of The Crown covers the years 1991 to 1997. It begins with the <a href="##" title="uscita">release</a> of a <a href="##" title="sondaggio">poll</a> which revealed that more than half of Britons wanted the Queen to abdicate and Charles to ascend to the throne, and it ends with the <a href="##" title="schiacciante, lett. ‘a valanga’">landslide</a> victory of Prime Minister Tony Blair. As the <a href="##" title="responsabile del programma">showrunner</a> Peter Morgan explained in a promotional Netflix interview, public opinion on the monarchy has changed significantly since the 1990s:
**Peter Morgan (English accent): **Season five <a href="##" title="svilupparsi nel contesto, confrontarsi">plays against</a> a period of real criticism and uncertainty and unconfidence. It’s quite shocking how <a href="##" title="apertamente">overtly</a> critical people were of the monarchy at that time. </p>

<h2 id="playing-a-royal">playing a royal</h2>

<p>One of the most significant traits of the show is the casting of its protagonists; the actors <a href="##" title="fare il ruolo, interpretare">portraying</a> prominent characters change as the historical timeline progresses. Claire Foy played Queen Elizabeth II from age twenty-one to thirty-seven, and Olivia Colman from thirty-eight to fifty-three. It is now Imelda Staunton who <a href="##" title="incarnare">embodies</a> the monarch in her most <a href="##" title="turbato">troubled</a> middle age. The veteran actor <a href="##" title="sintetizzare, riassumere">sums up</a><strong> </strong><a href="##" title="succintamente">succinctly</a> the difficulties her character <a href="##" title="affrontare">faces</a>. 
**Imelda Staunton (English accent): **It does start with people questioning: “Do we need the monarchy? Do we need the Queen?” And she has to ride that particular storm.</p>

<h2 id="empty"> </h2>

<h2 id="reluctant-princess">RELUCTANT PRINCESS</h2>

<p>Through the season’s ten episodes, viewers enjoy a filmic development of the big events that <a href="##" title="dare forma, determinare">shaped</a> recent royal and British history, but also the subtle, <a href="##" title="silenziosi">quiet</a> dramas that occurred. This is exemplified by the series of circumstances that, in the words of the Queen herself, defined her ‘‘annus horribilis’’. She refers to 1992, a year that ended with the divorce of Charles and Diana.
In fact, the psychological evolution of Princess Diana is <a href="##" title="potrebbe dirsi, per così dire">arguably</a> the main focus of the entire season. <a href="##" title="rappresentare">Depicted</a> as a woman driven to extremes by a cold, rigidly-conservative family, Diana’s <a href="##" title="suppliche">pleas</a> for compassion as well as her relationship with the media <a href="##" title="ci ricorda molto">much remind us</a> of the recent <a href="##" title="racconti, storie">accounts</a> of Meghan Markle, who has shared her own troubling experiences with the British royals. </p>

<h2 id="empty-1"> </h2>

<h2 id="end-of-illusion">END OF ILLUSION</h2>

<p>Episode 8 includes a very convincing <a href="##" title="ricostruzione">re-enactment</a> of the famous 1995 BBC interview, where Diana stated that ‘‘there were three of us in this marriage”; a scene which very much <a href="##" title="essere un riflesso">mirrors</a> the recent interview Diana’s son Harry and his wife Meghan gave to Oprah Winfrey. Australian actor Elizabeth Debicki replaces Emma Corrin as a <a href="##" title="trentenne, sulla trentina d’anni">thirty-something</a> Diana, who has very much <a href="##" title="svegliarsi">awoken</a> from the royal <a href="##" title="favola">fairy tale</a> she thought she was <a href="##" title="sposarsi">marrying into</a>:
**Elizabeth Debicki (Australian accent): **As a result of the marriage <a href="##" title="crollare">breaking down</a> and how she becomes more and more <a href="##" title="allontanata">removed</a> from the rest of the royal family, that of course sort of encourages her to grow other pieces of her life in an attempt to sort of <a href="##" title="recuperare">recoup</a> control of the ones that feel like they’re <a href="##" title="perdere il controllo">spiralling</a>. </p>

<h2 id="tradition-and-duty">TRADITION AND DUTY</h2>

<p>Prince Charles is depicted as an <a href="##" title="ostinato">opinionated</a> man who cannot wait to take the throne, but who is deeply unpopular among the British public. This is in <a href="##" title="sconcertante">striking</a> contrast to a Queen viewed as  both stable and beloved amongst her subjects. Dominic West plays a — perhaps too-handsome, some have <a href="##" title="affermare, difendere l’opinione">argued</a> — Prince Charles, <a href="##" title="hacerse cargo">taking over</a> from Josh O’Connor. West discusses his role.
**Dominic West (English accent): **The great tensions that you see in this season that Peter’s written about is between this 1950s <a href="##" title="prospettiva">outlook</a> on the monarchy and on public life and on marriage, and the modern day and how they <a href="##" title="scontrarsi">clash</a>, and how Diana really represents the modern day and Charles is sort of <a href="##" title="atrapado">caught</a> between the two. </p>

<h2 id="empty-2"> </h2>

<h2 id="the-other-woman">THE OTHER WOMAN</h2>

<p>Charles is also <a href="##" title="atrapado">caught</a> between two women: his wife and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who begins to attract the attention of the press in a way she much dislikes, as the actor Olivia Williams, who plays the role this season, points out:
**Olivia Williams (English accent): **Camilla goes from being a sort of an —inverted commas — close friend of Charles to being the subject of media scrutiny.</p>

<h2 id="there-is-no-bad-publicity">there is no bad publicity </h2>

<p>Intense scrutiny is itself what has accompanied the series and elevated it to a global hit. Publicity — even bad publicity — has proven to be the key to success in terms of viewer numbers. However, from former Prime Minister Sir John Major, portrayed on the show, to Dame Judi Dench  — who has played two queens, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth I — , to Jonathan Dimbleby, friend and biographer of Charles, a number of public figures close to the royal family have felt <a href="##" title="obbligati, costretti">compelled</a> <a href="##" title="dare l’opinione">to speak out</a> against this season of The Crown, calling it “<a href="##" title="ridicolo, assurdo">nonsensical</a>” and even “<a href="##" title="di cattivo gusto">tasteless</a>”. Their proximity to the royals, however, is also at play. Choosing this occasion <a href="##" title="dare l’opinione">to speak up</a>, while they remained silent on other occasions — when serious accusations were made against Prince Andrew, for example, or when Meghan Markle <a href="##" title="portare l’attenzione su qualcosa">called out</a> racism within the royal institution — suggests <a href="##" title="pregiudizio, parzialità">bias</a> at best and hypocrisy at worst. Ultimately, however, it remains <a href="##" title="dipendere da">up to</a> viewers to see how they feel about season five of The Crown and its treatment of the British monarchy.</p>

<h2 id="re-casting-the-royals-as-time-goes-by">re-casting the royals as time goes by</h2>

<p>**Princess Diana. **We get to see two very different Dianas: while Emma Corrin plays an innocent, hopeful princess, Elizabeth Debicki <a href="##" title="incarnare">embodies</a> a disillusioned, exhausted woman who is nevertheless ready to break free from the role that has been keeping her captive. 
<strong>King Charles III.</strong> Both Josh O’Connor and Dominic West have two main tasks to achieve: to make it clear that he is an unusually <a href="##" title="ostinato">opinionated</a> royal, and to <a href="##" title="trasmettere">convey</a> that he married Diana <a href="##" title="per dovere">out of duty</a>, while his heart was always set on Camilla.
<strong>Elizabeth II.</strong> Claire Foy, Olivia Colman and Imelda Staunton portray Elizabeth II as consistent in her <a href="##" title="moderazione">restraint</a>. They all succesfully humanise a character which, if in the wrong hands, could have been perceived as cold and <a href="##" title="distante">detached</a>.</p>
