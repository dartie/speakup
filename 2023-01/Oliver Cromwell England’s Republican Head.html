<p>Oliver Cromwell ha affascinato gli storici per centinaia di anni: per alcuni fu un dittatore assassino, per altri un difensore della libertà religiosa e parlamentare. Nato in una famiglia di semplici contadini, divenne il leader dell&rsquo;unico periodo repubblicano dell&rsquo;Inghilterra.</p>

<p>Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) is one of the most controversial figures in British (if not world) history. A modest farmer, he <a href="##" title="ascendere">rose</a> through his radical religious <a href="##" title="credenze">beliefs</a> and military <a href="##" title="abilità, capacità">skills</a> to become Britain’s Lord Protector. <a href="##" title="governare">Ruling</a> over a republic, Cromwell was the only <a href="##" title="che non appartiene all’aristocrazia">non-royal</a> ever to rule the country. </p>

<h2 id="strong-beliefs-credenze">strong <a href="##" title="credenze">beliefs</a></h2>

<p>Cromwell was a devout Puritan, and he entered Parliament in 1640, determined to cut the remaining <a href="##" title="vincoli">links</a> of the country’s dominant Protestant Church to its Roman Catholic past. The Church of England had broken its <a href="##" title="relazioni">ties</a> with the Catholic Church in the 16th century, but religious differences, sometimes <a href="##" title="violente, sanguinose">bloody</a> ones, still existed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I tell you we will cut off his head with the crown upon it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="political-disagreements">Political Disagreements</h2>

<p>These religious differences were an important part of the increasingly serious disagreements between the King, Charles I (Protestant but married to a Catholic queen), and Parliament, as the two sides fought over the <a href="##" title="governo, amministrazione">running</a> of the country. Charles believed in the divine right of kings to rule, while Parliament wanted to control his powers. The disagreements finally ended in a <a href="##" title="vendicativa">bitter</a> civil war (1642-51).</p>

<h2 id="leading-role">Leading Role</h2>

<p>Cromwell had taken a leading role on the Parliamentary side, attacking royal powers. As the country moved towards civil war, the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, he decided to help Parliament <a href="##" title="reclutare soldati">raise troops</a>. He then entered the army. Given his <a href="##" title="mancanza">lack</a> of military experience, his rise in this new army was spectacular. A captain in 1642, he was a <a href="##" title="tenente">lieutenant</a> general by 1645. He was made Lord General for campaigns in Ireland (1649-50) and Scotland (1650-51). Cromwell had a great ability to  <a href="##" title="infondere">instil</a> self-belief in his soldiers, and he looked after them like a mother!</p>

<h2 id="irish-campaign">Irish Campaign</h2>

<p>The Irish campaign was incredibly controversial. Before the campaign, the Catholics had <a href="##" title="sollevarsi, ribellarsi">risen up</a> against the Protestants, killing thousands, some cruelly. English reports exaggerated the violence. Cromwell went to Ireland principally to attack Royalist troops preparing to fight, but also <a href="##" title="vendicare">to avenge</a> the killings. His troops killed thousands of Catholic men, women and children, as well as hundreds of Catholic <a href="##" title="preti">priests</a>, using extreme violence.</p>

<h2 id="the-king-s-execution">THE King’s Execution</h2>

<p>The Parliamentarians captured the King in 1647. He was <a href="##" title="mettere sotto process">put on trial</a>, found guilty of tyranny and treason and then executed — the only public execution of a British head of state — with Cromwell <a href="##" title="pesantemente coinvolto">heavily involved</a>. The masked executioner wore a <a href="##" title="parrucca">wig</a> and a false <a href="##" title="barba">beard</a> to protect his identity. In 1653, Cromwell became Lord Protector, ruling the country as a republic, but with many of the powers of a king. </p>

<h2 id="restoring-the-monarchy">Restoring the Monarchy</h2>

<p>Cromwell led the country until his death in 1658. Charles I’s son then returned from the Netherlands to be crowned King Charles II. In 1661, Cromwell’s body was <a href="##" title="rimuovere">removed</a> from Westminster Abbey and <a href="##" title="appendere">hanged</a>. Over two hundred years later, in 1899, a statue of Cromwell was erected outside Parliament. Considering the number of public statues <a href="##" title="per forza, forzatamente">forcibly</a> <a href="##" title="rimuovere">removed</a> in recent years, <a href="##" title="potrebbe avere i giorni contati">its days may be numbered</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put your TRUST in God, my boys,
and keep your <a href="##" title="polvere da sparo">POWDER</a> <a href="##" title="seca">DRY</a>.</p>
