# Selena Gomez: Speaking Up On Mental Health   [C1]

La giovane cantante americana ha appena pubblicato un documentario che rispecchia intimamente la sua realtà: sorprendentemente, ricorda quella di tanti giovani di tutto il mondo. Sempre in movimento, sempre condizionata dalle leggi del mercato e di conseguenza, colpita da seri problemi di salute mentale.

Lately, more and more celebrities have been revealing the profound mental health [struggles](## "lotte, difficoltà") they go through on a regular basis. From Meghan Markle to Jennifer Aniston, to Bella Hadid and now Selena Gomez, public figures are telling us that they too are human. However, it is alarming that these days the human condition is so widely [plagued](## "devastare") with anxiety and depression. It appears that we are going through a pandemic of mental health [struggles](## "lotte, difficoltà") that preceded Covid but has been [exacerbated](## "esacerbare") by it.

## her mind & her
Selena Gomez is the latest celebrity [to open up](## "aprirsi, sincerarsi"). In her new Apple TV documentary My Mind & Me the singer, actress and film producer talks about her [struggles](## "lotte, difficoltà") with the chronic autoimmune [disease](## "malattia"), lupus. But these are not the main reasons for her suffering: in the documentary, she speaks [candidly](## "sinceramente, ingenuamente") about how [overwhelmed](## "sopraffatta") she feels by being constantly [on the move](## "da un posto all’altro, in movimento"), ever since she was extremely young. She says she [craves](## "desiderare fortemente") the [warmth](## "calore") of living somewhere that feels more like a community, says she wishes she could just be a mum, “normal”, and how she loves her art, but feels the constant pressure to satisfy the market. In a promotional interview for Apple TV, Gomez explained that the film’s [lens](## "messa a fuoco, prospettiva")[shifted](## "cambiare")  from its original [focus.](## "obiettivo principale")
**Selena Gomez (American accent): **We started to film my trip to Kenya and we thought maybe we could just do a quick little [short](## "cortometraggio") on this adventure that we’re going on and this experience. Then I had to go straight to London and Paris, and I quickly realized that all of this stuff that was going on in my life it all started with me. It all started with how am I feeling? How am I navigating through all of these different things that are going on in my life. How am I surviving. And [ultimately](## "in definitiva"), we realized it was going to be a story about my mental health journey, it’s not going to be necessarily a [puff piece](## "pezzo (articolo o film) elogiativo"). It’s gotta show every part of me, and that’s the good, the bad, the ugly and the real.

## ALIENATED YOUTH
One might be led to think that someone as wealthy and successful as Gomez would not be able to inspire empathy or be [relatable](## "vicina, somigliante"). However, the singer’s [struggles](## "lotte, difficoltà") [resonate](## "ricordare, somigliare") deeply with those of young people everywhere: constantly [on the move](## "da un posto all’altro, in movimento"), working for [lower wages](## "stipendi più bassi"), and paying higher rents. Most young people do not share Gomez’s wealth, but they do share her feeling of alienation. 
**Selena Gomez:** I had been so inundated with comments about my body. I had been told [that] I needed to look better, that I needed to dress cooler. And I was trying to be someone I wasn’t. And I think that is abusive. And I realized that watching that back, I’m never going to let anyone ever again make me feel that way. And I gained my [strength](## "forza") back when I realized, actually no, that girl wasn’t [lame](## "debole"), that girl didn’t need a better body. I was meant to be exactly who I am. And once I was [released](## "liberata") from a voice in my life, I did not fall, I actually [rose up](## "alzarsi"). 

## INTRUSIVE PRESS
In the documentary, Gomez also makes clear that the celebrity press are not only intrusive, but also fabricate stories. Not long ago, she was photographed with her ex’s (Justin Bieber) new partner, Hailey Bieber, revealing a supposed [vitriol](## "rancore") between the two women that was entirely invented by a few [media outlets](## "piattaforme mediatiche") for personal gain. Gomez opening up to the public about her mental health [issues](## "problemi") is [yet another](## "ancora un altro") voice telling us what normalcy actually feels like, something which should have us worried.
**Selena Gomez:** I don’t mind being the person who is a voice of mental health, because it’s my life and it’s a part of who I am. And I want people to start becoming more and more comfortable with that conversation. And I want it to stop being this [label](## "etichetta") that terrifies people, or people don’t believe in it, or think it’s not a real thing. If I would have [released](## "liberata") this documentary before the pandemic, people may would have thought I was crazy. So it was really interesting to hear people react to this movie and actually saying “Oh, I did not know I had that, but I did struggle with that as well.” If I am able to help one person with this, I am on cloud nine forever. But I hope I that am remembered by my heart, and I’m remembered by simply wanting to see people for who they are and love them authentically, truly, and as purely as I possibly can.
