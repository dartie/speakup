<p>Per quasi cinque decenni lo yacht Britannia è stato il palazzo galleggiante e il mezzo di trasporto preferito della regina Elisabetta II e di suo marito, il duca di Edimburgo. Attualmente questa nave è un’importante attrazione turistica ormeggiata a Leith, vicino alla capitale scozzese.</p>

<p>On 16 April 1953, Queen Elizabeth II began her relationship with probably her favourite home with the words, “I name this ship Britannia. I wish success to her and to all who <a href="##" title="navigare">sail</a> in her.” Forty-four years later, on 11 December 1997, when the Queen <a href="##" title="sbarcare">stepped ashore</a> from the Royal <a href="##" title="yacht">Yacht</a> Britannia after her final trip, her normal composure left her and she <a href="##" title="piangere lacrime">shed a tear</a>. The exact moment — 3:01pm — is <a href="##" title="esporre">displayed</a> on all the ship’s clocks.</p>

<h2 id="a-royal-necessity">a royal necessity</h2>

<p>At the ship’s <a href="##" title="varo">launch</a>, the Queen explained the need for a Royal <a href="##" title="yacht">Yacht</a>, the 83rd in the Royal Family’s history. She felt “that a yacht was a necessity and not a luxury for the Head of our great British Commonwealth between whose countries the sea is no barrier, but the natural and indestructible <a href="##" title="autostrada">highway</a>.”</p>

<h2 id="one-million-miles">One Million Miles</h2>

<p>Britannia spent forty-four years in the service of Britain and the Commonwealth, making almost a thousand official visits. It <a href="##" title="navigare">sail</a>ed more than one million miles and <a href="##" title="fare scalo in un porto">called at more than six hundred ports</a> in 135 countries. It served as a <a href="##" title="mezzo">means</a> of transport, a <a href="##" title="scenario nel quale vengono prese decisioni politiche">theatre of state</a> and a home.</p>

<h2 id="palace-at-sea">Palace at Sea</h2>

<p>The Queen and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh (a naval officer), participated in the ship’s design and decoration. So the royal apartment was a clear guide to the couple’s interests and tastes. The Queen’s bedroom had a modest single bed, but the <a href="##" title="risalire">dated back</a> <a href="##" title="biancheria">linen</a> to Queen Victoria! 
Britannia was over 125 metres long. The Queen’s royal apartment occupied one-third of the ship. The rest was a working Royal Navy <a href="##" title="nave, barca">vessel</a>, although the ship was really a floating palace, with even telephones identical to those in Buckingham Palace. The <a href="##" title="equipaggio">crew</a> numbered 220 under the command of twenty-one officers, and included a Royal Marine band.</p>

<h2 id="specific-ship-rules">Specific Ship Rules </h2>

<p>Britannia had its own specific rules. To avoid excessive noise, the <a href="##" title="equipaggio">crew</a> wore <a href="##" title="scarpe sportive">gym shoes</a>, and there was no <a href="##" title="megafono">tannoy</a> system or <a href="##" title="grida">shouting</a> — telephones and hand signals were used to communicate orders. The yacht also had a garage for the Queen’s Phantom V Rolls Royce, but <a href="##" title="paraurti">bumpers</a> had to be removed to permit the car to <a href="##" title="avere lo spazio sufficiente">fit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="time-for-retirement">Time for Retirement</h2>

<p>By the late 1990s, Britannia was showing its age. On June 30, 1997, it performed its final state role in the <a href="##" title="restituzione">handover</a> of Hong Kong to China. It returned to Britain to be <a href="##" title="smantellare">decommissioned</a> at Portsmouth. In line with its long, illustrious career, the world-famous ship was allowed a dignified retirement. Britannia <a href="##" title="navigare">sail</a>ed into the tourist world and can now be visited in Edinburgh as Scotland’s most popular tourist attraction. More than 350,000 people visit the iconic ship every year.</p>
