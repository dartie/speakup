Season five of The Crown is now streaming on Netflix and, [as expected](## "come era da aspettarsi"), it has [taken the internet by storm](## "invadere, inondare"). Reviews are divisive: heavy criticism on the one hand and [outstanding](## "eccezionale") [praise](## "lode") on the other. Historical [happenstance](## "casualità, coincidenza") has [preempted](## "anticipare") the arrival of this fifth fictional [instalment](## "stagione"); with King Charles III recently ascended to the throne after the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II, the debate over the purpose of the British monarchy is [gaining traction](## "diventare rilevante") once again. 
This season of The Crown covers the years 1991 to 1997. It begins with the [release](## "uscita") of a [poll](## "sondaggio") which revealed that more than half of Britons wanted the Queen to abdicate and Charles to ascend to the throne, and it ends with the [landslide](## "schiacciante, lett. ‘a valanga’") victory of Prime Minister Tony Blair. As the [showrunner](## "responsabile del programma") Peter Morgan explained in a promotional Netflix interview, public opinion on the monarchy has changed significantly since the 1990s:
**Peter Morgan (English accent): **Season five [plays against](## "svilupparsi nel contesto, confrontarsi") a period of real criticism and uncertainty and unconfidence. It’s quite shocking how [overtly](## "apertamente") critical people were of the monarchy at that time. 

## playing a royal
One of the most significant traits of the show is the casting of its protagonists; the actors [portraying](## "fare il ruolo, interpretare") prominent characters change as the historical timeline progresses. Claire Foy played Queen Elizabeth II from age twenty-one to thirty-seven, and Olivia Colman from thirty-eight to fifty-three. It is now Imelda Staunton who [embodies](## "incarnare") the monarch in her most [troubled](## "turbato") middle age. The veteran actor [sums up](## "sintetizzare, riassumere")** **[succinctly](## "succintamente") the difficulties her character [faces](## "affrontare"). 
**Imelda Staunton (English accent): **It does start with people questioning: “Do we need the monarchy? Do we need the Queen?” And she has to ride that particular storm.

##  

## RELUCTANT PRINCESS
Through the season’s ten episodes, viewers enjoy a filmic development of the big events that [shaped](## "dare forma, determinare") recent royal and British history, but also the subtle, [quiet](## "silenziosi") dramas that occurred. This is exemplified by the series of circumstances that, in the words of the Queen herself, defined her ‘‘annus horribilis’’. She refers to 1992, a year that ended with the divorce of Charles and Diana.
In fact, the psychological evolution of Princess Diana is [arguably](## "potrebbe dirsi, per così dire") the main focus of the entire season. [Depicted](## "rappresentare") as a woman driven to extremes by a cold, rigidly-conservative family, Diana’s [pleas](## "suppliche") for compassion as well as her relationship with the media [much remind us](## "ci ricorda molto") of the recent [accounts](## "racconti, storie") of Meghan Markle, who has shared her own troubling experiences with the British royals. 

##  

## END OF ILLUSION
Episode 8 includes a very convincing [re-enactment](## "ricostruzione") of the famous 1995 BBC interview, where Diana stated that ‘‘there were three of us in this marriage”; a scene which very much [mirrors](## "essere un riflesso") the recent interview Diana’s son Harry and his wife Meghan gave to Oprah Winfrey. Australian actor Elizabeth Debicki replaces Emma Corrin as a [thirty-something](## "trentenne, sulla trentina d’anni") Diana, who has very much [awoken](## "svegliarsi") from the royal [fairy tale](## "favola") she thought she was [marrying into](## "sposarsi"):
**Elizabeth Debicki (Australian accent): **As a result of the marriage [breaking down](## "crollare") and how she becomes more and more [removed](## "allontanata") from the rest of the royal family, that of course sort of encourages her to grow other pieces of her life in an attempt to sort of [recoup](## "recuperare") control of the ones that feel like they’re [spiralling](## "perdere il controllo"). 

## TRADITION AND DUTY
Prince Charles is depicted as an [opinionated](## "ostinato") man who cannot wait to take the throne, but who is deeply unpopular among the British public. This is in [striking](## "sconcertante") contrast to a Queen viewed as  both stable and beloved amongst her subjects. Dominic West plays a — perhaps too-handsome, some have [argued](## "affermare, difendere l’opinione") — Prince Charles, [taking over](## "hacerse cargo") from Josh O’Connor. West discusses his role.
**Dominic West (English accent): **The great tensions that you see in this season that Peter’s written about is between this 1950s [outlook](## "prospettiva") on the monarchy and on public life and on marriage, and the modern day and how they [clash](## "scontrarsi"), and how Diana really represents the modern day and Charles is sort of [caught](## "atrapado") between the two. 

##  

## THE OTHER WOMAN
Charles is also [caught](## "atrapado") between two women: his wife and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who begins to attract the attention of the press in a way she much dislikes, as the actor Olivia Williams, who plays the role this season, points out:
**Olivia Williams (English accent): **Camilla goes from being a sort of an —inverted commas — close friend of Charles to being the subject of media scrutiny.

## there is no bad publicity 
Intense scrutiny is itself what has accompanied the series and elevated it to a global hit. Publicity — even bad publicity — has proven to be the key to success in terms of viewer numbers. However, from former Prime Minister Sir John Major, portrayed on the show, to Dame Judi Dench  — who has played two queens, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth I — , to Jonathan Dimbleby, friend and biographer of Charles, a number of public figures close to the royal family have felt [compelled](## "obbligati, costretti") [to speak out](## "dare l’opinione") against this season of The Crown, calling it “[nonsensical](## "ridicolo, assurdo")” and even “[tasteless](## "di cattivo gusto")”. Their proximity to the royals, however, is also at play. Choosing this occasion [to speak up](## "dare l’opinione"), while they remained silent on other occasions — when serious accusations were made against Prince Andrew, for example, or when Meghan Markle [called out](## "portare l’attenzione su qualcosa") racism within the royal institution — suggests [bias](## "pregiudizio, parzialità") at best and hypocrisy at worst. Ultimately, however, it remains [up to](## "dipendere da") viewers to see how they feel about season five of The Crown and its treatment of the British monarchy.

## re-casting the royals as time goes by
**Princess Diana. **We get to see two very different Dianas: while Emma Corrin plays an innocent, hopeful princess, Elizabeth Debicki [embodies](## "incarnare") a disillusioned, exhausted woman who is nevertheless ready to break free from the role that has been keeping her captive. 
**King Charles III.** Both Josh O’Connor and Dominic West have two main tasks to achieve: to make it clear that he is an unusually [opinionated](## "ostinato") royal, and to [convey](## "trasmettere") that he married Diana [out of duty](## "per dovere"), while his heart was always set on Camilla.
**Elizabeth II.** Claire Foy, Olivia Colman and Imelda Staunton portray Elizabeth II as consistent in her [restraint](## "moderazione"). They all succesfully humanise a character which, if in the wrong hands, could have been perceived as cold and [detached](## "distante").
