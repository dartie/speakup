# American Royalty: The Kennedys   [B2]

Il fascino di questa potente famiglia irlandese dal sangue blu ha sedotto l’opinione pubblica americana per decenni. L’influenza di questo tragico clan si sente ancora in numerosi aspetti della vita sociale e politica degli Stati Uniti.

For more than half a century the Kennedy family were considered the [closest](## "più vicino, più simile") thing America had to [royalty](## "famiglia reale"). Its members who elected to [public office](## "incarico pubblico") — most notably John F. Kennedy, elected as US President in 1961 — all served as Democrats, while others worked for the Democratic Party in an [array](## "serie, varietà") of roles. Famed for their [championing](## "sostegno") of social justice in America, the Kennedys were also [notorious](## "sfortunatamente conosciuti per") for their infidelities and rebellious [behaviour](## "comportamento").

## irish [heritage](## "eredità")
The Kennedy [heritage](## "eredità") has been [traced back](## "far risalire") to Ceineidi, 10th-century king of North Munster, southwest Ireland. The [kingdom](## "regno") of Munster was one of the ancient [kingdom](## "regno")s of Gaelic Ireland until it was [broken up](## "dividere, disintegrare") in 1118. Over the centuries, the O’Kennedy family lost their royal status, but remained powerful Irish Catholic [landowners](## "proprietari di terre"). That was until the 17th century, when their land was confiscated by the English invaders. With the Irish ‘O’ ordered to be [dropped](## "togliere, abbandonare, rinunciare") from their surname, the Kennedys became [traders](## "commercianti") in County Wexford.  In the 19th century, [widespread](## "generalizzata") poverty in Ireland [drove](## "spingere, portare a") Patrick Joseph Kennedy to emigrate to the US. In 1849, he found work in Boston as a [barrel maker](## "fabbricante di barili"), but then died of cholera. His son Patrick “P. J.” Kennedy went into business and served in the Massachusetts [state legislature](## "legislatura statale (organo del potere legislativo di ogni stato dell’Unione)"). P. J.’s son Joseph (“Joe”) made a fortune in banking. He worked in various positions in government, and was [appointed](## "nominare") US ambassador to the UK [in the lead-up to](## "in vista dell’arrivo di") World War Two.

## TRAGIC DECADE
Joe and his wife Rose, a prominent socialite, had nine kids, many better known by their [nicknames](## "nomignoli"): Joseph Jr., John (“Jack”), Rose Marie (“Rosemary”), Kathleen (“Kick”), Eunice, Patricia, Robert (“Bobby”), Jean, and Edward (“Ted”). The 1940s were difficult years for the family: the [eldest](## "maggiore"), Joseph Jr., died when his warplane exploded; Rosemary had violent [mood swings](## "cambi di umore, alti e bassi emozionali") and was given a pre-frontal lobotomy which left her permanently incapacitated; Kick scandalised the family by [eloping](## "fuggire per sposarsi") to England with a Protestant aristocrat, and soon afterwards was killed in a plane crash. 

## THE KENNEDY CURSE
In the 1950s family members began [to climb the political ladder](## "salire al potere"). However, the 1960s were a traumatic decade for them: after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, and that of his brother, Senator Robert Kennedy, in 1968, rumours spread of a “Kennedy [curse](## "maledizione")”. Nevertheless, the Kennedys were certainly privileged: when Ted [[drove](## "spingere, portare a") his car into](## "schiantarsi contro, andare a finire dentro") a lake in 1969, killing the young woman who he was travelling with, he still [managed](## "riuscire")** **to become a universally-respected US senator, and [remained so](## "rimase tale") for forty-seven years afterwards.

## YOUNGER GENERATIONS
In later generations, the power of the Kennedys has declined and there have been many well-publicised tragedies. Bobby’s son David died of a drug overdose in 1984, and Michael died in a skiing accident in 1997. Jack’s son John Jr. died in yet another plane crash. Ted’s daughter Kara and Patricia’s son Christopher both died of heart attacks when they were [middle aged](## "di mezza età"). More recently, Bobby’s granddaughter Saoirse died of a drug overdose, while his granddaughter Maeve [drowned](## "affogare"). There are, however, younger Kennedys who have followed in the family [footsteps](## "seguire le orme") and been successful in US politics: Bobby’s grandson Joe III served in Congress, and the late-President’s daughter Caroline Kennedy is the current US ambassador to Australia.
