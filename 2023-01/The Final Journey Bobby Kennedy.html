<p>Nel giugno del 1968, un treno di ventuno carrozze portò la salma di Robert F. Kennedy da New York a Washington. Pochi giorni prima era stato assassinato. Lungo i 360 chilometri di tragitto, folle di migliaia di cittadini diedero l’ultimo addio a un politico considerato portavoce delle minoranze più svantaggiate.</p>

<p>Robert Francis Kennedy is perhaps less well-known than John Fitzgerald Kennedy, US president from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. However, ask any American over sixty where they were on 8 June 1968, and they will tell you. </p>

<h2 id="us-attorney-general">us attorney general</h2>

<p>Born in 1925, Robert, better-known as Bobby, was the seventh of nine children of the prominent political Kennedy family. As a lawyer, he fought organised crime and earned a reputation as an <a href="##" title="inflessibile, incorruttibile">uncompromising</a> <a href="##" title="procuratore">prosecutor</a>. With his older brother in the White House, Bobby was <a href="##" title="nominare">appointed</a> US <a href="##" title="procuratore generale">Attorney General</a>. He served as the President’s closest <a href="##" title="consigliere">advisor</a>, taking part in major decisions, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the resolution of which <a href="##" title="evitare">averted</a> nuclear war with the USSR.</p>

<h2 id="civil-rights">CIVIL RIGHTS</h2>

<p>After John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Bobby discarded the <a href="##" title="dura, fredda">tough</a> image he had cultivated and began to advocate for issues related to civil rights and social justice. He opposed US <a href="##" title="coinvolgimento">involvement</a> in the Vietnam War and <a href="##" title="sensibilizzare">raised awareness</a> of poverty in the country, <a href="##" title="proporre">sponsoring</a> legislation to bring businesses to impoverished communities. </p>

<h2 id="bobby-for-president">BOBBY FOR PRESIDENT</h2>

<p>In 1968, Bobby took the risky step of <a href="##" title="sfidare">challenging</a> Lyndon Johnson, the <a href="##" title="incarica">incumbent</a> president of his own party, the Democrats. New York Senator at the time, Bobby became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, <a href="##" title="attrarre">appealing</a> to poor, African-American, Hispanic and young voters. When Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in April 1968, Bobby asked King’s followers not to respond with <a href="##" title="odio">hatred</a>, and his empathy earned their respect. </p>

<h2 id="shot-in-action">SHOT IN ACTION</h2>

<p>On 5 June 1968, just after winning the California primary, Kennedy was shot three times <a href="##" title="da vicino">at close range</a> at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, and died a day later. The shooter was twenty-four-year-old Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan, in <a href="##" title="presunta">alleged</a> <a href="##" title="rappresaglia">retaliation</a> for Kennedy’s support of Israel. But Bobby’s assassination, like that of his brother, continues to be the subject of controversy.</p>

<h2 id="the-funeral-train">THE FUNERAL TRAIN</h2>

<p>On 8 June 1968, after his funeral in New York, the body of the senator was taken by train to Washington D.C. destined for <a href="##" title="sepoltura">burial</a> at Arlington National Cemetery. The journey usually took four hours, but the train travelled at half the speed because hundreds of thousands of people had <a href="##" title="riunirsi">gathered</a> on <a href="##" title="corsie">station platforms</a> and <a href="##" title="lungo le vie">by the tracks</a>. The photographer Paul Fusco was among the passengers on the train. The pictures he took, compiled in a book published in 2000, stand as a testament to the human impact of a world-changing event.</p>
