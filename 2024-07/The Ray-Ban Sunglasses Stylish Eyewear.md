Sunglasses are an ancient idea, but a modern fashion phenomenon. Like other premium brands, Ray-[Bans](## "proibire, vietare") are worn as much for their stylish look as the practical protection they offer from the sun. A pair of these iconic American [shades](## "occhiali da sole") can cost you anything from a couple of hundred to over three thousand dollars.

## SNOW GOGGLES
The earliest sunglasses were created for [snow blindness](## "cecità dovuta alla neve"). In ancient times, the Inuit, an indigenous people of the Arctic region, wore [goggles](## "occhiali protettivi") made of [driftwood](## "legname"), bone or [walrus ivory](## "avorio di tricheco") with [slits](## "fessure") cut into them to protect their eyes. In the 12th century, Chinese opticians made their own sunglasses using the [gemstone](## "gemma, pietra preziosa") [smoky quartz](## "quarzo affumicato"). 

## HIGHER GOALS
The story of modern sunglasses begins in the United States. Founded in Rochester, New York in 1853, Bausch & Lomb made precision optical equipment, including eye glasses, telescopes and camera lenses. As pilots were vulnerable to the [glare](## "luccichio") of sunlight, the company became a [trusted supplier](## "fornitore di fiducia") to the US Air Force. As technology improved, and planes flew higher, the need for eye protection became more urgent.

## THE AVIATOR
In 1929, Bausch & Lomb began work with veteran pilot John A. Macready to create sunglasses that reduced the [dazzle](## "bagliore") of the stratosphere, and prevented the pilot’s [goggles](## "occhiali protettivi") from [misting up](## "appannarsi"). These anti-[glare](## "luccichio") glasses had plastic [frames](## "montature")and green lenses the shape of [teardrops](## "lacrime"). In 1937, they went on sale to civilians under the name ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses’, so-called because they reduced UV and infra-red rays [harmful](## "dannosi") to the eyes. In 1939, relaunched with a metal frame, they were named the Ray-Ban Aviator. 

## RETRO-CHIC
Almost unheard of until the 1920s, by the late 1930s sunglasses were a must-have product. In the US, around twenty million pairs were sold in 1937. Ray-Ban looked for celebrity [endorsement](## "sponsorizzazione"), and Hollywood was quick to bring their style to the big-screen. The music world quickly followed. The Ray-Ban [Wayfarer](## "viandante") with its trapezoidal lenses and shiny [rivets](## "rivetti"), was introduced in 1952 and worn by high-profile figures like James Dean, Audrey Hepburn and John F. Kennedy. The Ray-Ban Clubmaster, launched in the 1980s, was another bestseller; these [drew on](## "ispirarsi") a 1950s intellectual look affiliated with cultural rebels such as Malcolm X. The 1990s brought [wraparound](## "avvolgente") styles, and further luxury models followed.

## WHO ARE YOU?
In 1999, Bausch & Lomb sold Ray-Ban to Italy’s Luxottica Group, which launched a brand-new [Wayfarer](## "viandante") model [two years on](## "due anni dopo"). However, the original Aviator, [Wayfarer](## "viandante") and Clubmaster remained in high demand, and continue to shape popular culture today. Enigmatic yet assertive, they can [conceal](## "nascondere"), reveal or transform character: stylish rebel, [high-flyer](## "persona in gamba"), [cool cat](## "figo"), intrepid explorer, good cop or bad cop; wear a pair of Ray-[Bans](## "proibire, vietare"), and choose your own identity.
