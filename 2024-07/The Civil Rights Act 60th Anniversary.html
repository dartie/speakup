<p>Sono passati sei decenni da quando la discriminazione razziale è stata ufficialmente abolita negli Stati Uniti, un traguardo legale che ha portato alla lotta per la parità dei diritti in molti altri ambiti della società.</p>

<p>Sixty years ago, US congressmen <a href="##" title="approvare">passed</a> a new law to end discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex and national origin. The Civil Rights <a href="##" title="legge">Act</a> of 1964 was the <a href="##" title="massimo raggiungimento">crowning achievement</a> of the civil rights movement. It marked a new era of legislative equality. The <a href="##" title="di [rife](## &quot;diffusa">landmark</a>rimento, fondamentale&rdquo;) law continues to protect voter rights and prohibit racial segregation and employment discrimination. Its introduction, however, was the result of a long and difficult journey.</p>

<h2 id="racial-tension">RACIAL TENSION</h2>

<p>After the American Civil War, the abolition of slavery did not create equality in the United States. The 14th <a href="##" title="emendamento">Amendment</a> was added to the Constitution in 1868, <a href="##" title="concedere">granting</a> citizenship to formerly enslaved people. It also gave citizens equal protection under the law. However, over a century later, despite many additional acts, laws and executive orders, discrimination was still <a href="##" title="diffusa">rife</a>. There was massive resistance to desegregation in the southern states. There, the Jim Crow laws considered racial segregation as constitutional. When prominent civil rights activist Medgar Evers was murdered by a member of the white supremacist, segregationist organisation White Citizens’ Council, in Jackson, Mississippi in 1963, racial tension reached <a href="##" title="punto di ebollizione">boiling point</a>.</p>

<h2 id="moral-crisis">MORAL CRISIS</h2>

<p>John F. Kennedy declared a moral crisis on national television and promised new legislation. In the second term of his presidency, he presented the most <a href="##" title="esauriente">comprehensive</a> civil rights <a href="##" title="progetto di legge">bill</a> ever written. He said: “The United States will not be fully free until all of its citizens are free.” The new Civil Rights <a href="##" title="legge">Act</a> was going through several <a href="##" title="bozze">drafts</a> when tragedy <a href="##" title="colpire">struck</a>: Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in November 1963.</p>

<h2 id="filibuster">FILIBUSTER</h2>

<p>Vice-president Lyndon B. Johnson <a href="##" title="prestare giuramento">was sworn in</a>. He immediately made the <a href="##" title="progetto di legge">bill</a> a priority. Creating a bi-partisan coalition, he managed <a href="##" title="superare">to overcome</a> strong opposition from the South. This included the longest <a href="##" title="ostruzionismo">filibuster</a> in US political history, which occupied the Senate for sixty working days. The <a href="##" title="progetto di legge">bill</a> <a href="##" title="approvare">passed</a> by a vote of 73 to 27. It was then approved in the House of Representatives. Just over a year after Kennedy’s proposal, on 2 July 1964, the <a href="##" title="progetto di legge">bill</a> was signed into law. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. called it a “second emancipation.”</p>

<h2 id="legal-equality">LEGAL EQUALITY</h2>

<p>The Civil Rights <a href="##" title="legge">Act</a> also inspired further legislation, such as the Voting Rights <a href="##" title="legge">Act</a> of 1965, to ensure <a href="##" title="imparziale">unbiased</a> voting practices, and the Fair Housing <a href="##" title="legge">Act</a> of 1968, to prevent discrimination in the buying or renting of property. The fight against racism was far from over but, legally, at least, segregation had been defeated in the United States.  </p>

<h2 id="jim-crow">JIM CROW</h2>

<p>The Jim Crow laws <a href="##" title="fare rispettare, applicare">enforced</a> racial segregation in the southern states from the late 1800s until 1965. The name comes from a popular <a href="##" title="spettacolo di menestrelli">minstrel show</a>. A white performer <a href="##" title="con la faccia dipinta di nero">in blackface</a> played a lazy, ridiculous black person called Jim Crow. He spoke with a funny accent and acted <a href="##" title="oltraggiosamente">outrageously</a> to make audiences laugh. The caricature came to represent discrimination against African-Americans. When the statutes of segregation <a href="##" title="approvare">passed</a> in the south, they became known as the ‘Jim Crow laws’.
