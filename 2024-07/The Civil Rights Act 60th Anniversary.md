# The Civil Rights Act: 60th Anniversary   [B1]

Sono passati sei decenni da quando la discriminazione razziale è stata ufficialmente abolita negli Stati Uniti, un traguardo legale che ha portato alla lotta per la parità dei diritti in molti altri ambiti della società.

Sixty years ago, US congressmen [passed](## "approvare") a new law to end discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex and national origin. The Civil Rights [Act](## "legge") of 1964 was the [crowning achievement](## "massimo raggiungimento") of the civil rights movement. It marked a new era of legislative equality. The [landmark](## "di [rife](## "diffusa")rimento, fondamentale") law continues to protect voter rights and prohibit racial segregation and employment discrimination. Its introduction, however, was the result of a long and difficult journey.

## RACIAL TENSION
After the American Civil War, the abolition of slavery did not create equality in the United States. The 14th [Amendment](## "emendamento") was added to the Constitution in 1868, [granting](## "concedere") citizenship to formerly enslaved people. It also gave citizens equal protection under the law. However, over a century later, despite many additional acts, laws and executive orders, discrimination was still [rife](## "diffusa"). There was massive resistance to desegregation in the southern states. There, the Jim Crow laws considered racial segregation as constitutional. When prominent civil rights activist Medgar Evers was murdered by a member of the white supremacist, segregationist organisation White Citizens’ Council, in Jackson, Mississippi in 1963, racial tension reached [boiling point](## "punto di ebollizione").

## MORAL CRISIS
John F. Kennedy declared a moral crisis on national television and promised new legislation. In the second term of his presidency, he presented the most [comprehensive](## "esauriente") civil rights [bill](## "progetto di legge") ever written. He said: “The United States will not be fully free until all of its citizens are free.” The new Civil Rights [Act](## "legge") was going through several [drafts](## "bozze") when tragedy [struck](## "colpire"): Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in November 1963.

## FILIBUSTER
Vice-president Lyndon B. Johnson [was sworn in](## "prestare giuramento"). He immediately made the [bill](## "progetto di legge") a priority. Creating a bi-partisan coalition, he managed [to overcome](## "superare") strong opposition from the South. This included the longest [filibuster](## "ostruzionismo") in US political history, which occupied the Senate for sixty working days. The [bill](## "progetto di legge") [passed](## "approvare") by a vote of 73 to 27. It was then approved in the House of Representatives. Just over a year after Kennedy’s proposal, on 2 July 1964, the [bill](## "progetto di legge") was signed into law. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. called it a “second emancipation.”

## LEGAL EQUALITY
The Civil Rights [Act](## "legge") also inspired further legislation, such as the Voting Rights [Act](## "legge") of 1965, to ensure [unbiased](## "imparziale") voting practices, and the Fair Housing [Act](## "legge") of 1968, to prevent discrimination in the buying or renting of property. The fight against racism was far from over but, legally, at least, segregation had been defeated in the United States.  

## JIM CROW
The Jim Crow laws [enforced](## "fare rispettare, applicare") racial segregation in the southern states from the late 1800s until 1965. The name comes from a popular [minstrel show](## "spettacolo di menestrelli"). A white performer [in blackface](## "con la faccia dipinta di nero") played a lazy, ridiculous black person called Jim Crow. He spoke with a funny accent and acted [outrageously](## "oltraggiosamente") to make audiences laugh. The caricature came to represent discrimination against African-Americans. When the statutes of segregation [passed](## "approvare") in the south, they became known as the ‘Jim Crow laws’.
