It’s impossible to include every notable location when compiling a list of [must-see](## "da vedere, da non perdere") destinations in a country as vast as Australia. However, we’ve curated one that [showcases](## "mostrare") its diverse landscapes, from the iconic Outback to Australia’s vibrant cities, stunning beaches, [lush](## "rigogliose") rainforests, and [rugged](## "vigorose") mountains, providing a [glimpse](## "dare un’occhiata") into the country’s beauty and variety.
Standing at an impressive height of 348 metres (higher than the Eiffel Tower) and some 3.6 kilometres wide, Uluru (formerly known as Ayers Rock) is a majestic [sandstone](## "di arenaria") monolith located in the Northern Territory, near the geographical centre of Australia. This iconic landmark is not only a natural wonder, but also a culturally significant site for the Aboriginal people of the region. According to their [beliefs](## "credenze"), it was created at [the dawn of time](## "all’alba del tempo") when ancestral spirits traversed the [barren](## "sterile, arido") landscape, shaping the landforms we see today.
The second-largest national park in Australia after the Munga-Thirri-Simpson desert, Kakadu is renowned for its abundance of Aboriginal cultural sites, numbering over five thousand. Visitors to Kakadu can immerse themselves in [breathtaking](## "mozzafiato") landscapes [teeming](## "essere pieni di") with diverse flora and fauna. The park is home to over twenty species of frog, as well as snakes and crocodiles. Among its birds are unique species like the so-called [Jesus birds](## "jacane"), famed for their ability to walk on water — although actually they are [treading](## "camminare") on aquatic plants.
The largest city in Australia, Sydney offers a vibrant mix of attractions that capture the country’s diverse character. A perfect starting point for exploration is Hyde Park, one of its most iconic parks. Nearby, Circular [Quay](## "molo") [bustles with](## "brulicare di") bars, restaurants and shops, offering a stunning view of the Harbour Bridge, affectionately known as the [Coathanger](## "appendiabiti"). Adjacent to this area lies The Rocks, where the first colonisers settled, and the iconic Sydney Opera House, inaugurated in 1973 and now a symbol of the city. Sydney’s multiculturalism is exemplified by its fascinating Chinatown, a bustling pedestrian area [brimming with](## "essere colmo di") shops, entertainment [venues](## "locali") and authentic Asian cuisine. The city also [boasts](## "vantare") renowned zoos and aquariums, providing opportunities for visitors to encounter Australian wildlife such as koalas, kangaroos and dugongs. One of Sydney’s prime attractions is its picturesque coastline, with Bondi Beach a highlight. This expansive stretch of sand offers approximately a kilometre of pristine [shoreline](## "battigia"), along with a plethora of aquatic activities for visitors to enjoy.
Often ranked first as the [world’s most liveable city](## "la città al mondo dove si vive meglio"), Melbourne is Australia’s second most populous city and serves as the gateway to the Great Ocean Road, a [scenic](## "spettacolare") 4.5-hour drive which leads to the [awe-inspiring](## "impressionanti") Twelve Apostles, [towering](## "imponenti") [limestone pillars](## "pilastri calcarei") rising forty-five metres from the Southern Ocean. Once connected to the mainland [cliffs](## "scogliere"), they now stand as majestic formations on their own. Historically prosperous, Melbourne emerged as one of the wealthiest and largest metropolises by the late 1880s. Renowned for its vibrant cultural scene, the city [has garnered](## "ottenere") acclaim as a hub for street art, theatre and live music. It also hosts events like the Australian Grand Prix and the Australian Open. A mere (by Australian standards) two-hour drive south of Melbourne lies Phillip Island, famed for hosting the world’s largest little penguin colony, offering visitors a unique wildlife experience.
Located across the Bass [Strait](## "stretto") off the southeast coast of Australia, and 240km from the mainland, Tasmania is a heart-shaped island, 364km long and 30km wide, surrounded by 334 smaller islands. Its remote location adds to its [allure](## "fascino"), making it an intriguing destination. Tasmania [boasts](## "vantare") some of the world’s oldest flora and fauna and is renowned for its natural wonders, ranging from deep lakes to extraordinary beaches like Wineglass Bay, consistently ranked among the top ten on the planet. Among its unique wildlife is the iconic Tasmanian devil, a carnivorous marsupial about the size of a small dog, notorious for having one of the strongest [bites](## "morsi") in the world.
Situated in Western Australia, the Kimberley region was among the first to be colonised. This area provides unique experiences, including camel rides along the stunning Cable Beach. It is also home to one of Australia’s most iconic roads, the Gibb River Road, which traverses the heart of the region. Kimberley is also notable for the town of Kununurra, where the Waringarri Aboriginal Arts Centre [showcases](## "mostrare") the artistic work [crafted](## "fare a mano") by local Aboriginal people, offering visitors a chance to connect with their culture.
Another captivating region in Western Australia, the Pilbara region is renowned for its distinctive red earth and rich Aboriginal culture. The majority of the region’s population resides in the Roebourne coastal sand plain, which also serves as the primary hub for industry and commerce. To the east lies a captivating desert, [sparsely](## "scarsamente") populated by a small number of Aboriginal peoples. The Pilbara is home to stromatolites: fossilised evidence of Earth’s oldest life forms, dating back over 3.4 billion years.
The city of Cairns, located in the state of Queensland, served as an Allied Forces [staging ground](## "base operativa") during World War Two. Today, it is a [thriving](## "florida") tourist destination renowned for its flourishing cruising industry, with a vibrant waterfront esplanade, bustling with shops and restaurants. Cairns offers convenient access to the [breathtaking](## "mozzafiato") Daintree Forest and the Great Barrier Reef. Nearby, the coastal town of Port Douglas is a hidden gem, boasting gorgeous beaches, [lush](## "rigogliose") rainforests and a laid-back atmosphere.
The Great Australian [Bight](## "baia") is an expansive open bay; often considered part of the Indian Ocean, some argue it is part of the Southern Ocean. It is characterised by [towering](## "imponenti") cliff faces reaching heights of around a hundred metres, adorned with [rocky capes](## "promontori rocciosi"). Formed approximately fifty million years ago, the Great Australian [Bight](## "baia") marks the separation of Antarctica and Australia. This region is renowned for its diverse marine life, making it an ideal destination for whale-watching enthusiasts. It serves as a vital habitat for various whale species, as well as abundant populations of Southern [bluefin tuna](## "tonno rosso"), attracting fishing enthusiasts from around the world.
Located just a ninety-minute drive from Sydney, the Blue Mountains offer endless [hiking trails](## "sentieri escursionistici") amidst [sandstone](## "di arenaria") [cliffs](## "scogliere") and eucalyptus forests, which give the region the blue haze it is named after. This area [boasts](## "vantare") numerous remarkable spots, including the Three Sisters. Located in the city of Katoomba, this unusual rock formation features in an Aboriginal legend that tells the story of three sisters who fell in love with three brothers from a neighbouring tribe. Another significant location is Echo Point, which serves as the gateway to multiple walks and other viewpoints. Among them is the adventurous Giant [Stairway](## "scalinata") including an impressive staircase of almost one thousand [steps](## "gradini") leading to the valley floor below.
