Joe: I’m glad you suggested this [walk](## "passeggiata"). I feel more relaxed already
Amber: Yes, there’s nothing like a hike through nature to unwind.
Joe: Look, there are [beavers](## "castori") over there!
Amber: Oh, they’re adorable!
Joe: And busy at work, building a [dam](## "diga"). What an amazing [sight](## "vista").
Amber: They reintroduced them recently, to [restore](## "ripristinare") the wetlands.
Joe: Really? Were there not many left, then?
Amber: No, they were [hunted](## "cacciare") almost to extinction, for their [fur](## "pelliccia").
Joe: Poor things! Well, I’m glad they’re back. I wonder what other creatures we’ll spot today.
Amber: I think there are [deer](## "cervo") around here somewhere. Lots of birdlife, too.
Joe: Cool! We’ll have to keep looking up. Let’s see if we can catch a glimpse of any birds.
Amber: Haha, we’ll make a birdwatcher out of you yet!
