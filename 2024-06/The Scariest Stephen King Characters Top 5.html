<p><a href="##" title="trame">Plots</a> and settings are important to any story, but they need <a href="##" title="persuasivi">compelling</a> characters <a href="##" title="trovare il favore di, risuonare">to truly resonate with</a> readers. As the master of horror, Stephen King has <a href="##" title="creare">crafted</a> some of the most terrifying villains that <a href="##" title="perseguitare">haunt</a> our nightmares. Among them are paranormal entities, demons and ghosts, but also ordinary men, women and even children who <a href="##" title="precipitare nella follia">slide into madness</a>.
Jack Torrance, a recovering alcoholic, takes a job as <a href="##" title="portinaio, custode">caretaker</a> of the Overlook Hotel while it is closed for the winter. The hotel is <a href="##" title="maledetto">cursed</a> and Torrance becomes increasingly unstable and violent towards his wife and son. Torrance was immortalised by Jack Nicholson in the 1980 movie adaptation. He sent <a href="##" title="fare venire i brividi">chills down your spine</a> with a phrase that was not in the book: “Heeeere’s Johnny!”
Randall Flagg is one of Stephen King’s recurring villains, appearing in numerous works. While his genesis was in King’s 1969 poem The Dark Man, Flagg first shows up as a manipulative demon in The Stand, a post-apocalyptic novel about good versus evil. A charismatic character, he leads the evil group of survivors. Flagg is finally killed in the last Dark Tower novel.
At just two years old, Gage Creed is the youngest of Stephen King’s cast of scary characters. His <a href="##" title="prematura">untimely</a> death devastates his family. His father buries him in a <a href="##" title="perseguitare">haunt</a>ed cemetery, hoping he will come back to life. Gage is resurrected as a homicidal monster, possessed by an evil spirit. He kills a neighbour and his mother, before his father<a href="##" title="giustiziare">puts him to death</a> again.
A <a href="##" title="proteiforme">shape-shifting</a> entity terrorises children in the town of Derry, Maine. Returning every generation, the creature <a href="##" title="attirare">lures</a> them into the <a href="##" title="fognature">sewers</a> to devour them. Discovering that scared humans taste even better, ‘It’ commonly appears as a <a href="##" title="inquietante">creepy</a> dancing clown called Pennywise. He is finally vanquished by the Losers’ Club, made up of seven childhood friends.
Annie Wilkes first appears as a <a href="##" title="integra">wholesome</a> nurse, who rescues the author of a series of romance novels. The gradual realisation of her mental instability is what makes her one of Stephen King’s scariest characters. It is said that she is King’s personal favourite. Actress Kathy Bates won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Wilkes in the 1990 movie adaptation.  </p>
