<p>Joe: I’m glad you suggested this <a href="##" title="passeggiata">walk</a>. I feel more relaxed already
Amber: Yes, there’s nothing like a hike through nature to unwind.
Joe: Look, there are <a href="##" title="castori">beavers</a> over there!
Amber: Oh, they’re adorable!
Joe: And busy at work, building a <a href="##" title="diga">dam</a>. What an amazing <a href="##" title="vista">sight</a>.
Amber: They reintroduced them recently, to <a href="##" title="ripristinare">restore</a> the wetlands.
Joe: Really? Were there not many left, then?
Amber: No, they were <a href="##" title="cacciare">hunted</a> almost to extinction, for their <a href="##" title="pelliccia">fur</a>.
Joe: Poor things! Well, I’m glad they’re back. I wonder what other creatures we’ll spot today.
Amber: I think there are <a href="##" title="cervo">deer</a> around here somewhere. Lots of birdlife, too.
Joe: Cool! We’ll have to keep looking up. Let’s see if we can catch a glimpse of any birds.
Amber: Haha, we’ll make a birdwatcher out of you yet!</p>
