<p>Al suo esordio nel 1888, la penna Parker ha rivoluzionato il modo di scrivere a mano. Elegante ma soprattutto pratica, unisce la precisione tecnica con l’ergonomia e l’estetica. Rimane molto apprezzata anche nell’era digitale.</p>

<p>In an age of rapid, <a href="##" title="digitare">typed</a> communication over digital <a href="##" title="dispositivi">devices</a>, there is something timeless and <a href="##" title="serio">earnest</a> about a <a href="##" title="penna stilografica">fountain pen’s</a><a href="##" title="flusso d’inchiostro">flow of ink</a> words on paper. Combining elegance, simplicity and technical precision, the Parker pen is one of the most popular items of <a href="##" title="cancelleria">stationery</a> in the world. Its founder was George Safford Parker, an American entrepreneur who dedicated his life to the design and production of exemplary pens. His mission statement, used successfully in advertising campaigns, was: “It will always be possible to make a better pen.”</p>

<h2 id="faulty-pens">FAULTY PENS</h2>

<p>Born in 1863 in Shullsburg, Wisconsin, Parker worked as a telegraphy instructor and sold fountain pens part-time for the John Holland Pens Company, but he spent much of his <a href="##" title="tempo libero">spare time</a> repairing the faults in those of his students. Frustrated by the <a href="##" title="inaffidabile">unreliable</a> ink flow of most fountain pens, provoking <a href="##" title="perdite">leakages</a> and <a href="##" title="sbavare">smudging</a>, he designed and patented his own ink <a href="##" title="sistema di alimentazione">feed system</a>. In 1888, he launched his own company: the Parker Pen Company Limited.</p>

<h2 id="lucky-curve">LUCKY CURVE</h2>

<p>From a factory in nearby Janesville, Parker <a href="##" title="dare inizio, fare da pioniere">pioneered</a> new and more reliable pen designs. His big breakthrough came in 1894 with the Lucky Curve anti-leak ink <a href="##" title="sistema di alimentazione">feed system</a>, which used capillary action <a href="##" title="drenare">to drain</a> unused ink into the reservoir. With a smooth <a href="##" title="flusso d’inchiostro">flow of ink</a> guaranteed, Parker pens were soon recognised for their <a href="##" title="a prova di errore, infallibile">fail-proof</a> excellence. In an era of hand-written letters and hand-signed documents, Parker pens became bestsellers and appeared at the 1904 international exhibition, St. Louis World’s Fair, in Missouri. </p>

<h2 id="innovation">INNOVATION</h2>

<p>Parker continued to improve and innovate: <a href="##" title="senza giunture">the jointless</a> pen in 1898, the Duofold Big Red pen in the Roaring Twenties and Quink (<a href="##" title="inchiostro a rapida asciugatura">quick drying ink</a>) in 1931. Although Parker died in 1937, his son Kenneth continued the company’s pioneering spirit. In 1941, Parker produced the most famous model in fountain pen history: the Parker 51. <a href="##" title="commercializzare">Marketed</a> as “The World’s Most Wanted Pen”, the 51 was inspired by aeronautical design (Kenneth Parker was an aviator in World War One) and its <a href="##" title="snelli, affusolati">streamline</a> contours and precision delighted users across the globe. </p>

<h2 id="concentration">CONCENTRATION</h2>

<p>While vintage Parker pens are highly collectible, the firm still launches new, improved models onto the market. In recent years, Parker pens and fountain pens in general have experienced a revival in sales, with writing enthusiasts, professionals and collectors adding a touch of sophistication to their everyday lives. Fountain pen users believe that the smooth and <a href="##" title="continuo">steady</a> <a href="##" title="flusso d’inchiostro">flow of ink</a> helps to improve concentration and attention to detail, memory retention and comprehension. The act of writing with a fountain pen <a href="##" title="coinvolgere">engages</a> all the senses, making the text produced seem so much more genuine.  </p>
