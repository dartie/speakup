<p>Famed for its <a href="##" title="fangosi">muddy</a> fields and <a href="##" title="festaioli">revellers</a> wearing <a href="##" title="stivali di gomma">wellies</a>, Glastonbury Festival in Somerset is a <a href="##" title="rito di passaggio">rite of passage</a> for many who live for live music. The first edition of the festival was held on 19 September 1970 and attended by 1,500 people, who paid just £1 to enter the festival grounds. Since then, Glastonbury has become the biggest outdoor music and performing arts festival in the world. It has a capacity of 210,000 people, who pay anything from £370 (€448) per person to attend. </p>

<h2 id="king-arthur">KING ARTHUR</h2>

<p>The music festival takes place on the site of a working farm called Worthy Farm. It is programmed every year for four years, with the fifth year a ‘<a href="##" title="anno di maggese">fallow year</a>’ to allow the land to recover. It is located near Pilton, in an area known for its natural beauty. It is also a place of historical and mythological interest, as the legendary King Arthur is said to have been <a href="##" title="seppellire">buried</a> in Glastonbury Abbey. If that’s the case, then the <a href="##" title="risuonare fragorosamente">blaring</a> music and the <a href="##" title="calpestare con forza">stomping</a> of all those partygoers may have him <a href="##" title="rivoltarsi nella tomba">rolling over in his grave</a>! </p>

<h2 id="youth-culture">YOUTH CULTURE</h2>

<p>This year, Glastonbury is being held between 25 and 29 June. World-renowned musicians perform, but it is also a <a href="##" title="trampolino">springboard</a> for emerging talent. Alongside the music, which is, of course, the main attraction, there are other forms of artistic expression. This is i<a href="##" title="conforme a">n keeping with</a> the intentions of the co-founder of the event, <a href="##" title="produttore lattiero">dairy farmer</a>Michael Eavis, who wrote the following when he registered the company: “The Glastonbury Festival <a href="##" title="avere come obiettivo">aims</a> to encourage and stimulate youth culture from around the world in all its forms, including pop music, dance music, jazz, folk music, <a href="##" title="teatro sperimentale">fringe theatre</a>, drama, mime, circus, cinema, poetry and all the creative forms of art and design, including painting, sculpture and textile art.”</p>

<h2 id="entertaining-inspiring">ENTERTAINING &amp; INSPIRING</h2>

<p>Throughout its history, Glastonbury has <a href="##" title="includere, presentare">featured</a> many performances that have <a href="##" title="entrare nella storia">gone down in music history</a>. Among them is the 2007 concert by singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse. Some artists have <a href="##" title="stupire, sbalordire">stunned</a> audiences with <a href="##" title="impressionanti">awe-inspiring</a> spectacles and celebrity appearances. In 2019, biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough made a surprise appearance on stage, <a href="##" title="entusiasmare">delighting</a> audiences. Attenborough showed his support for the festival’s decision to go plastic-free. The popularity of the event has grown over the years and is appreciated by the public both in the UK and abroad. In 2024, Michael Eavis received a knighthood in recognition of his services to music and charity.
