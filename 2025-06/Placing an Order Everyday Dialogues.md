## NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!

An account, in relation to purchasing, refers to the customer [file](## "fascicolo") held by the [supplier](## "fornitore"), which contains payment and shipping details.
CMYK is an acronym for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. It refers to the four primary colours of [ink](## "inchiostro") used in four-colour printing.
Purchase is a synonym for ‘buy’.
When you have the [goods](## "merce") available and ready for sale, you have them in stock.
Minimum order quantity – or MOQ – refers to the smallest number of units a [supplier](## "fornitore") is [willing](## "disposto") to sell to a customer in a single order.
In the context of pricing, off means a reduction or discount from the usual price.
When you charge a cost to an account, it will be added to that account and paid according to the [pre-arranged](## "prestabiliti") terms.
That’s all for now is a common way of saying you don’t need anything else at this moment in time.
To ship out means to send or [dispatch](## "spedire").
