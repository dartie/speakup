<p>London’s Victoria and Albert Museum offers unprecedented access to its collections with the opening of V&amp;A East <a href="##" title="magazzino, deposito">Storehouse</a>. This new site is part of East Bank, London’s sports and cultural quarter in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford. The new museum provides visitors with an opportunity to explore one of the world’s most significant museum collections in a new way.</p>

<h2 id="new-design">NEW DESIGN </h2>

<p>Designed by world-renowned architects Diller, Scofidio + Renfro, the V&amp;A East <a href="##" title="magazzino, deposito">Storehouse</a> has four levels and covers 16,000sqm, an area larger than thirty <a href="##" title="campi da basket">basketball courts</a>. It serves as both a working museum store and a visitor attraction, <a href="##" title="costruito appositamente">purpose-built</a> <a href="##" title="ospitare">to house</a> 250,000 objects, 350,000 library books, and nearly a thousand archives from the Victoria and Albert Museum’s vast collections.</p>

<h2 id="in-fashion">IN FASHION</h2>

<p>The collection covers five thousand years of creativity, <a href="##" title="esibire">showcasing</a> a diverse range of objects, from Roman frescoes and Samurai swords to iconic fashion by designers such as Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood or Balenciaga. Visitors can also explore the Glastonbury Festival Archive, Elton John’s costumes, Mid-Century furniture, and even an iPhone.</p>

<h2 id="self-guided">SELF-GUIDED</h2>

<p>A <a href="##" title="primato mondiale">world-first</a> in size, scale, and ambition, the V&amp;A East <a href="##" title="magazzino, deposito">Storehouse</a> opened on 31 May 2025, offering a new kind of museum experience. It goes beyond traditional exhibitions, inviting visitors to see behind the scenes of a working museum store. Unlike in most museums, there are no <a href="##" title="vetrine di vetro">glass cases</a> separating visitors from the collections. Instead, a self-guided experience, <a href="##" title="schermi con trasmissioni in diretta">live-feed screens</a> and a glass <a href="##" title="punto panoramico">overlook</a> allow visitors to watch museum conservators at work and learn how objects are collected, preserved and <a href="##" title="mostrare">displayed.</a>
The <a href="##" title="magazzino, deposito">Storehouse</a> also introduces an Order an Object Service, which allows visitors to book a time to view any object <a href="##" title="da vicino">up close</a>. In addition, the museum offers daily Object Encounters, where experts and museum staff provide inspiring talks that highlight different aspects of the collection. </p>

<h2 id="rich-history">RICH HISTORY</h2>

<p><a href="##" title="insieme a">Alongside</a> interactive installations, the museum features over a hundred curated displays celebrating East London’s rich history of creativity, activism and <a href="##" title="artigianato">craftsmanship</a>. New acquisitions include works by fashion designer Imane Ayissi and other international artists. 
A diverse programme of live events and creative workshops will <a href="##" title="svolgersi durante">run throughout</a> the year, while special content from the David Bowie Archive will launch in September 2025.
The V&amp;A East <a href="##" title="magazzino, deposito">Storehouse</a> is the first of two new V&amp;A East sites. The second, V&amp;A East Museum, will open in spring 2026 and focus on fashion, design, music and performance, with a strong emphasis on <a href="##" title="sottorappresentate">underrepresented</a> voices and contemporary storytelling.</p>

<h2 id="the-victoria-and-albert-museum">THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM </h2>

<p>The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) was founded in 1852 after the Great Exhibition of 1851, a major event that showcased art, design, and industry from around the world. Originally called the Museum of Manufactures, it was created in South Kensington, London, to inspire British artists and designers by displaying <a href="##" title="straordinari">outstanding</a> works. Later, it was renamed after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and expanded to include fashion, <a href="##" title="belle arti">fine arts,</a> and decorative objects. Over time, the V&amp;A became the world’s leading museum of art, design, and performance, offering visitors a chance to explore five thousand years of creativity and <a href="##" title="artigianato">craftsmanship</a>. Today, the V&amp;A is famed for its big name exhibitions and social caché, with celebrities attending <a href="##" title="sfarzosi">lavish</a> <a href="##" title="feste di inaugurazione">opening parties</a>. Since 2017, its current director has been Tristram Hunt, a <a href="##" title="antica">former</a> Labour politician with a doctorate in Victorian History. Hunt has described the pressures of the job at a time when other institutions are <a href="##" title="coinvolte">caught up</a> in debates on the repatriation of contested objects (like the British Museum), or <a href="##" title="ridurre il personale">cutting staff</a> (like the Tate Museum.) In its attempts to open up its collections and tell new stories in new ways, the V&amp;A has been hit by culture war controversies <a href="##" title="alimentare">fuelled</a> by the <a href="##" title="emozioni accese">heated emotions</a> of social media. This included the museum being criticised for describing <a href="##" title="antica">former</a> prime minister Margaret Thatcher as a “villain” alongside Adolf Hitler and Osama Bin Laden in a display about British humour. The <a href="##" title="etichetta">label</a> had to be changed. </p>
