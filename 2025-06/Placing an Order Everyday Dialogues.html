<p>Pier: Hello, I’d like to place an order for some <a href="##" title="cartucce della stampante">printer ribbons</a>, please
Nora: Good afternoon. Do you have an account with us?
Pier: Yes, we do. The company name is DropShop Limited.
Nora: Ah, yes, I’ve found you on the system. Which ones would you like to purchase?
Pier: The same as usual: the CMYK multipack for the 5350 model. Do you have those in stock?
Nora: We <a href="##" title="certamente sì">certainly do</a>! How many do you need? The minimum order quantity is twenty units.
Pier: I need around forty. Is there a discount for large orders?
Nora: Indeed there is! You get 10 per cent off on orders over fifty.
Pier: I guess I’ll take fifty then! Please charge it to our account.
Nora: Done! Is there anything else you need?
Pier: No, that’s all for now. How soon will we get them?
Nora: We’ll ship them out as soon as the payment has cleared, so you could have them tomorrow
Pier: That’s excellent. Thanks so much for your help!
Nora:  You’re welcome! Have a nice day.</p>

<h2 id="now-let-s-review-the-vocabulary">NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!</h2>

<p>To place an order means to buy something in a commercial context.
An account, in relation to purchasing, refers to the customer <a href="##" title="fascicolo">file</a> held by the <a href="##" title="fornitore">supplier</a>, which contains payment and shipping details.
CMYK is an acronym for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. It refers to the four primary colours of <a href="##" title="inchiostro">ink</a> used in four-colour printing.
Purchase is a synonym for ‘buy’.
When you have the <a href="##" title="merce">goods</a> available and ready for sale, you have them in stock.
Minimum order quantity – or MOQ – refers to the smallest number of units a <a href="##" title="fornitore">supplier</a> is <a href="##" title="disposto">willing</a> to sell to a customer in a single order.
In the context of pricing, off means a reduction or discount from the usual price.
When you charge a cost to an account, it will be added to that account and paid according to the <a href="##" title="prestabiliti">pre-arranged</a> terms.
That’s all for now is a common way of saying you don’t need anything else at this moment in time.
To ship out means to send or <a href="##" title="spedire">dispatch</a>.
When a payment has cleared, it means that the transaction has been processed and the money has been transferred.</p>
