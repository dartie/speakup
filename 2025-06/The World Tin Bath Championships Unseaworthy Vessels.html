<p>In questa gara di beneficenza, un centinaio di partecipanti sfidano le fredde acque del mare d’Irlanda in una precaria vasca d’ottone: temerarietà o coraggio?</p>

<p>One of three self-governing island territories within the British Isles, the Isle of Man is an island of just 221 square miles (572 sq. km) located in the Irish Sea <a href="##" title="di fronte alla costa">off the northwest coast</a> of England. It is home to a sporting competition that really is <a href="##" title="unica nel suo genere">one of a kind</a>: the World <a href="##" title="latta">Tin</a> Bath Championships. The event takes place each year in Castletown on the south coast of the island. Castletown was the island’s historic capital until 1869, when a town <a href="##" title="più in alto">further up</a> the eastern coast called Douglas became the capital. Castletown is named after the medieval Castle Rushen, which has Viking origins. The town has been hosting the World <a href="##" title="latta">Tin</a> Bath Championships since 1971, when the first event was organised by the Castletown Real <a href="##" title="birra">Ale</a> Drinkers Society.</p>

<h2 id="unseaworthy">UNSEAWORTHY</h2>

<p>More than one hundred people compete in the unusual race held in Castletown’s Middle <a href="##" title="porto">Harbour</a>. They sit in tin baths and <a href="##" title="remare">paddle</a> furiously down a four hundred-metre course, while around two thousand people <a href="##" title="incitare">cheer them on</a> from the <a href="##" title="riva">shore</a>. <a href="##" title="si applicano regole rigide">Strict rules apply</a>, ensuring that no participants have a hidden advantage. The tin baths are far from <a href="##" title="adatto alla navigazione">seaworthy</a> and difficult to control, with some participants finding themselves floating off into the Irish Sea. Male, female and veteran categories participate in several rounds. The winners then race in the final. The winners are either those who are first to cross the finish line, or those who cover the longest distance before <a href="##" title="affondare">sinking</a>. </p>

<h2 id="machines-and-snakes">MACHINES AND SNAKES </h2>

<p>As well as the main event, other competitions take place. Among them are <a href="##" title="voli a propulsione umana">human-powered flights</a>, where participants create their own homemade flying machines which they use to try to fly around Castle Rushen. Another highlight is the Snake Race, where teams of six race their ‘snakes’ (six human team members tied together) through the water to the steps of a pub called The Glue Pot. </p>

<h2 id="fundraiser-event">FUNDRAISER EVENT</h2>

<p>This year’s World <a href="##" title="latta">Tin</a> Bath Championships will be held on 7 September and is an excuse to have a little <a href="##" title="spensierato">light-hearted</a> fun with family and friends. The championships see visitors from across the UK as well as <a href="##" title="da più lontano">further afield</a> <a href="##" title="arrivare">descend upon</a> Castletown. The Castletown Real <a href="##" title="birra">Ale</a> Drinkers Society uses the event to <a href="##" title="raccogliere fondi">raise money</a> for local <a href="##" title="organizzazioni benefiche">charities</a> as a <a href="##" title="mezzo, modo">means</a> to give something back to the community, as well as provide it with something to look forward to every year. As Boris Kitching, one of the event organisers, told the BBC last year: “Everyone told us how much fun they’d had, and even new entrants that sank said they would be back next year.”  </p>
