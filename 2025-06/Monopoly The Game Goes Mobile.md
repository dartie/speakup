Monopoly is one of the world’s most iconic [board games](## "giochi da tavolo"). Its origins go back to 1903, when an American game designer called Lizzie Magie invented an educational game called The [Landlord’s](## "proprietario") Game. Her intention was to illustrate Georgism, based on the economic principles of Henry George. Georgists are anti-monopolists. They believe that people should have equal access to the benefits of land, which is a natural resource. The [Landlord’s](## "proprietario") Game presented two distinct rule sets: one advocated for wealth distribution and another promoted monopolisation.

## VARIATIONS
Between 1906 and the 1930s, many variants of The [Landlord’s](## "proprietario") Game appeared in the US. As big American cities [reached for the skies](## "puntare in alto (costruire grattacieli)"), the games incorporated elements such as property trading and development. In 1932, Charles Darrow adapted the game, developing his own version, known as Monopoly, which he started selling locally. The game became extremely popular as the Great Depression [took hold](## "prendere piede") and toy and game manufacturer Parker Brothers acquired the rights to it in 1935.

## BETRAYAL
Parker Brothers marketed Monopoly as Darrow’s invention and ignored Magie’s contributions. It wasn’t until the 1970s, with legal battles over trademark rights and revelations by journalists, that the game’s true origins were revealed. Meanwhile, Monopoly was [making inroads](## "farsi strada") [abroad](## "all’estero"): while the original board featured Atlantic City streets, soon international versions were adapting local [landmarks](## "luoghi simbolici"). Today there are some 650 city versions, from Osaka to Cairo.

## SPIN OFFS
The company Hasbro bought Parker Brothers in 1991 and, with it, Monopoly. Under Hasbro, multiple alternative versions appeared. They included [spin](## "versione")-off versions for younger people, and those associated with major movie franchises. These include both Star Wars and Star Trek versions; a Game of Thrones Monopoly; a [Cheaters](## "imbroglioni") Edition — which encourages players to cheat, with penalties for getting caught —, and Monopoly Millionaire, where the goal is to be the first player to reach a million dollars. 

## SOCIALISM
There are also more critical, realistic or [downright](## "decisamente, davvero") darker Monopoly versions, potentially more in line with Magie’s original idea: Monopoly For [Sore Losers](## "cattivi perdenti") helps players who have bad luck; Monopoly Tropical [Tycoon](## "magnate") is set on an island threatened by [random weather events](## "eventi meteorologici casuali"). There is even a Monopoly Socialism game, where players move around the board working together to make a better community. They manage and contribute to projects such as an all-winners’ school or a [no-tip](## "dove non si accettano mance") vegan restaurant.  

## MONOPOLY APP BANKING
For some, the latest version of Monopoly is perhaps the darkest [yet](## "fino ad ora"), for others it is simply the way the world works. Monopoly App Banking introduces a digital [spin](## "versione") to the classic game that aligns with modern banking practices. It replaces the traditional banker role and paper money with a free mobile app. Players scan their bank and property cards into the app, which [handles](## "gestire") all financial transactions and property ownership. It incorporates mini-games that offer incentives [to hook](## "coinvolgere") younger players with interactive aspects. The classic properties have been updated to reflect contemporary real estate trends. The game board has been redesigned: it incorporates QR codes next to each property, which players can scan to access additional information and interactive elements. Properties have augmented reality (AR) capabilities so you can see them in 3D. The [Chance](## "fortuna") and [Community Chest](## "cassa comune") [Community Chest](## "cassa comune")20 cards have been digitised and appear as notifications. Railroads have been reimagined as transportation [hubs](## "centri"), including airports and high-speed train stations. And utility spaces now represent renewable energy sources, such as solar and [wind farms.](## "parchi eoli")
