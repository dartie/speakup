Famed for its [muddy](## "fangosi") fields and [revellers](## "festaioli") wearing [wellies](## "stivali di gomma"), Glastonbury Festival in Somerset is a [rite of passage](## "rito di passaggio") for many who live for live music. The first edition of the festival was held on 19 September 1970 and attended by 1,500 people, who paid just £1 to enter the festival grounds. Since then, Glastonbury has become the biggest outdoor music and performing arts festival in the world. It has a capacity of 210,000 people, who pay anything from £370 (€448) per person to attend. 

## KING ARTHUR
The music festival takes place on the site of a working farm called Worthy Farm. It is programmed every year for four years, with the fifth year a ‘[fallow year](## "anno di maggese")’ to allow the land to recover. It is located near Pilton, in an area known for its natural beauty. It is also a place of historical and mythological interest, as the legendary King Arthur is said to have been [buried](## "seppellire") in Glastonbury Abbey. If that’s the case, then the [blaring](## "risuonare fragorosamente") music and the [stomping](## "calpestare con forza") of all those partygoers may have him [rolling over in his grave](## "rivoltarsi nella tomba")! 

## YOUTH CULTURE
This year, Glastonbury is being held between 25 and 29 June. World-renowned musicians perform, but it is also a [springboard](## "trampolino") for emerging talent. Alongside the music, which is, of course, the main attraction, there are other forms of artistic expression. This is i[n keeping with](## "conforme a") the intentions of the co-founder of the event, [dairy farmer](## "produttore lattiero")Michael Eavis, who wrote the following when he registered the company: “The Glastonbury Festival [aims](## "avere come obiettivo") to encourage and stimulate youth culture from around the world in all its forms, including pop music, dance music, jazz, folk music, [fringe theatre](## "teatro sperimentale"), drama, mime, circus, cinema, poetry and all the creative forms of art and design, including painting, sculpture and textile art.”

## ENTERTAINING & INSPIRING
Throughout its history, Glastonbury has [featured](## "includere, presentare") many performances that have [gone down in music history](## "entrare nella storia"). Among them is the 2007 concert by singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse. Some artists have [stunned](## "stupire, sbalordire") audiences with [awe-inspiring](## "impressionanti") spectacles and celebrity appearances. In 2019, biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough made a surprise appearance on stage, [delighting](## "entusiasmare") audiences. Attenborough showed his support for the festival’s decision to go plastic-free. The popularity of the event has grown over the years and is appreciated by the public both in the UK and abroad. In 2024, Michael Eavis received a knighthood in recognition of his services to music and charity.
