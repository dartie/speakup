Fondata nel 1964 per contrastare il monopolio della BBC, l’emittente continua ad andare in onda nonostante tempeste, naufragi, mancanza di fondi e persino attacchi armati.

It’s hard to believe, given the wide choice of music available today, that the BBC held a monopoly on UK radio broadcasting until 1973. Celebrating its sixtieth anniversary this year, Radio Caroline was the first of a new wave of pirate radio stations to challenge and disrupt the state-owned service

## ready to rock
In the early 1960s, as rock music exploded across the [airwaves](## "onde radio"), the BBC [allocated](## "assegnare") just six hours a week to popular music on its UK network. The only competition came from Radio Luxembourg, which played hits from the major [record labels](## "etichette discografiche"). But how could anyone hear new, independent artists?

## OFFSHORE
In 1961, Ronan O’Rahilly, an Irish entrepreneur, arrived in London full of ideas for music promotion. He decided to set up his own radio station, on a boat, knowing that the British broadcasting laws only extended to a three-mile limit [offshore](## "al largo, in alto mare"). O’Rahilly named his new station Radio Caroline, after the daughter of US President John F. Kennedy. 

## ANCHORED
Together with businessman Alan Crawford, O’Rahilly prepared two ships for broadcasting. On 28 March 1964, the [[off the Suffolk coast](## "al largo della costa")MV](## "imbarcazione a motore (motor vessel)")Caroline anchored legally in international waters and announced: “This is Radio Caroline on 199, your all day music station”. Radio Caroline was on air...

## PIRATES
By autumn that year, Radio Caroline had seven million listeners. Inspired by O’Rahilly’s example, other pirate radio stations [took to the [airwaves](## "onde radio")](## "andare in onda"). The British government quickly introduced new legislation [to outlaw](## "dichiarare fuori legge") the stations, which were forced to close. Radio Caroline went [off air](## "non trasmettere più") for several years but was relaunched in the early 1970s. 

## LOVING AWARENESS
With its eclectic mix of album tracks and concept of [Loving Awareness](## "Amanti della conoscenza"), a form of peaceful [eastern](## "orientale") philosophy promoted by O’Rahilly, Radio Caroline had a strong new identity. Through the following decades, thanks to O’Rahilly, the [crew](## "squadra"), DJs and supporters, Radio Caroline stayed on air [despite](## "nonostante") storms, an armed [raid](## "incursione") by Dutch and British officials, [breakdowns](## "guasti"), a [sinking](## "affondamento"), and, always, a lack of money. When Ronan O’Rahilly died in April 2020, he left a lasting legacy: Radio Caroline was an act of musical rebellion, a philosophy, and a family of broadcast pioneers remaining on air [against all the odds](## "contro ogni previsione").
