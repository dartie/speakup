<p>When you find yourself <a href="##" title="bloccato">stuck</a> in a conversation and you have no idea what to say, ‘in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’ is the best word to imply that you <a href="##" title="riconoscere">acknowledge</a> <a href="##" title="esprimere qualcosa">the point made</a> but neither agree nor disagree. It’s a diplomat’s dream, the verbal equivalent of <a href="##" title="accennare con il capo">nodding</a>. </p>

<h2 id="in-truth">IN TRUTH</h2>

<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word ‘in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’ dates back to around 1330 and was first used by Robert Mannyng, an English poet and historian. The word comes from the prepositional phrase ‘in + dede’, an Old English noun for ‘a doing, an action, an event’ that later formed the related word ‘<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’. The meaning of ‘in <a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’ was ‘in fact, in truth, in reality’. Over time, the two words <a href="##" title="fondersi">merged</a> into one, becoming ‘in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’ while retaining their meaning of affirming or <a href="##" title="accentuare">stressing</a> a point.</p>

<h2 id="in-writing">IN WRITING</h2>

<p>Gradually, ‘in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’ started appearing in written texts. However, through the centuries it still maintained its function as an emphatic term meaning ‘without any question, in reality, <a href="##" title="in realtà">as a matter of fact</a>’. Today it is still found in formal <a href="##" title="contesti">settings</a>, but it is sometimes used informally too, though often ironically. It is used in written English as well as in conversation. </p>

<h2 id="in-addition">IN ADDITION</h2>

<p>The term ‘in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’ can be placed in different places in a sentence, and its primary function has always been to emphasise the truth of a <a href="##" title="affermazione">statement</a> or to show that the speaker strongly agrees with someone or something or confirms the information: “It is a beautiful day in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>.” 
The word, however, can also carry <a href="##" title="sfumati">nuanced</a> meanings. For example, it can be used to confirm and amplify a preceding <a href="##" title="affermazione">statement</a> by providing additional information: “He is a <a href="##" title="esperto">skilled</a> photographer. In<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>, his work has been exhibited in several galleries,” or to introduce a point that’s even more true than the last one you made: “The project is challenging, in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>, almost impossible.” The interjection ‘in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’ can sometimes be used to answer questions, meaning ‘yes, certainly’ or ‘yes, truly’: “Is this your first time here?” “In<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>.” Or it can perhaps be found as an expression of surprise, incredulity, irony: “In<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>! I can <a href="##" title="appena">scarcely</a> believe it.”</p>

<h2 id="in-use">IN USE</h2>

<p>So, next time you find yourself <a href="##" title="senza parole">at a loss for words</a>, remember the simple ‘in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’. It’s always there, ready to make you look <a href="##" title="saggio">wise</a>, interested and <a href="##" title="gradevoli">agreeable</a>, to make your point clear and strong, enrich your communication and help make your English sound more confident and assertive. Often, when you’re not sure what to say, ‘in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a>’ can be the perfect response. Just be careful not <a href="##" title="utilizzare eccessivamente">to over-use</a> it: that can in<a href="##" title="atto">deed</a> be counter-productive!  </p>
