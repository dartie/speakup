<p>It’s hard to believe, given the wide choice of music available today, that the BBC held a monopoly on UK radio broadcasting until 1973. Celebrating its sixtieth anniversary this year, Radio Caroline was the first of a new wave of pirate radio stations to challenge and disrupt the state-owned service</p>

<h2 id="ready-to-rock">ready to rock</h2>

<p>In the early 1960s, as rock music exploded across the <a href="##" title="onde radio">airwaves</a>, the BBC <a href="##" title="assegnare">allocated</a> just six hours a week to popular music on its UK network. The only competition came from Radio Luxembourg, which played hits from the major <a href="##" title="etichette discografiche">record labels</a>. But how could anyone hear new, independent artists?</p>

<h2 id="offshore">OFFSHORE</h2>

<p>In 1961, Ronan O’Rahilly, an Irish entrepreneur, arrived in London full of ideas for music promotion. He decided to set up his own radio station, on a boat, knowing that the British broadcasting laws only extended to a three-mile limit <a href="##" title="al largo, in alto mare">offshore</a>. O’Rahilly named his new station Radio Caroline, after the daughter of US President John F. Kennedy. </p>

<h2 id="anchored">ANCHORED</h2>

<p>Together with businessman Alan Crawford, O’Rahilly prepared two ships for broadcasting. On 28 March 1964, the <a href="##" title="imbarcazione a motore (motor vessel)"><a href="##" title="al largo della costa">off the Suffolk coast</a>MV</a>Caroline anchored legally in international waters and announced: “This is Radio Caroline on 199, your all day music station”. Radio Caroline was on air&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="pirates">PIRATES</h2>

<p>By autumn that year, Radio Caroline had seven million listeners. Inspired by O’Rahilly’s example, other pirate radio stations <a href="##" title="andare in onda">took to the <a href="##" title="onde radio">airwaves</a></a>. The British government quickly introduced new legislation <a href="##" title="dichiarare fuori legge">to outlaw</a> the stations, which were forced to close. Radio Caroline went <a href="##" title="non trasmettere più">off air</a> for several years but was relaunched in the early 1970s. </p>

<h2 id="loving-awareness">LOVING AWARENESS</h2>

<p>With its eclectic mix of album tracks and concept of <a href="##" title="Amanti della conoscenza">Loving Awareness</a>, a form of peaceful <a href="##" title="orientale">eastern</a> philosophy promoted by O’Rahilly, Radio Caroline had a strong new identity. Through the following decades, thanks to O’Rahilly, the <a href="##" title="squadra">crew</a>, DJs and supporters, Radio Caroline stayed on air <a href="##" title="nonostante">despite</a> storms, an armed <a href="##" title="incursione">raid</a> by Dutch and British officials, <a href="##" title="guasti">breakdowns</a>, a <a href="##" title="affondamento">sinking</a>, and, always, a lack of money. When Ronan O’Rahilly died in April 2020, he left a lasting legacy: Radio Caroline was an act of musical rebellion, a philosophy, and a family of broadcast pioneers remaining on air <a href="##" title="contro ogni previsione">against all the odds</a>. </p>
