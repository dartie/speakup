# Talk Like a Pirate: Ahoy, Me Hearties!   [B2]

Due amici amanti dei travestimenti hanno ideato nel 1995 una delle feste più stravaganti del calendario per celebrare con umorismo lo stile di vita dei pirati e il loro particolare modo di parlare.

Well, [shiver](## "tiritar") me [timbers](## "legname") and blow me down! It’s Talk Like a Pirate Day, savvy?* The unofficial annual holiday on 19 September is a [whimsical](## "stravagante") event that celebrates an idealised vision of pirates and piratical life. People [dress up](## "travestirsi") — in private or in public, if they [dare](## "osare")— and speak exclusively in pirate language all day

## Having a ball
Originating in the United States in 1995, the idea came from two friends playing racquetball at the YMCA in Oregon. John Baur and Mark Summers [goaded](## "stimolare") each other by shouting pirate phrases. They had so much fun doing it, they proclaimed 19 September Talk Like a Pirate Day. The date was chosen simply because there were no other holidays and it was John’s ex-wife’s birthday, so it would be easy to remember. In 2002, they wrote a letter to the Miami Herald and humourist Dave Barry promoted it in his column. The idea [caught on](## "diventare di moda") and the holiday went global. 

## Celebrity pirates
[Cap’n Slappy](## "Capitano ceffone") and [Ol’ Chumbucket](## "Vecchio secchio per esche") are the alter egos of the founders of International Talk Like a Pirate Day. They have appeared on stage and on television and have co-authored several books about pirate culture, including A Li’l Pirate’s ABSeas, “a piratical [romp](## "commedia spassosa") through the alphabet with all that that implies. Sometimes rude, sometimes [downright](## "davvero") dangerous and subversive, but always fun and always funny.”

## Defying the rules
[Ol’ Chumbucket](## "Vecchio secchio per esche") explains: “Pirates, they’re an expression of freedom... Pirates were the freest people on earth. They lived by their own rules; they rejected convention.” Songs have been written about it — and [prayers](## "preghiere"), too. The holiday has been declared a Holy Day by the Pastafarian movement, also known as the Church of The Flying Spaghetti Monster.

## Join in the fun
Talk Like a Pirate Day is celebrated on the internet, too. Online games and websites hide pirate-themed [Easter eggs](## "messaggi occulti (Lett. uova di Pasqua)") and Facebook once published its site in pirate language. In the real world, not everyone chooses to [dress up](## "travestirsi"). Anyone can join in the fun by spending the day watching movies, reading books and playing games with friends. There is no [shortage](## "scarsità") of pirate-themed material available. At the end of the day, Summers explains it’s all about ‘Pirattitude’: “If you do what you want, because it’s what you want, then you’re living like a pirate.”
