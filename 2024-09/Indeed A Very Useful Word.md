When you find yourself [stuck](## "bloccato") in a conversation and you have no idea what to say, ‘in[deed](## "atto")’ is the best word to imply that you [acknowledge](## "riconoscere") [the point made](## "esprimere qualcosa") but neither agree nor disagree. It’s a diplomat’s dream, the verbal equivalent of [nodding](## "accennare con il capo"). 

## IN TRUTH
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word ‘in[deed](## "atto")’ dates back to around 1330 and was first used by Robert Mannyng, an English poet and historian. The word comes from the prepositional phrase ‘in + dede’, an Old English noun for ‘a doing, an action, an event’ that later formed the related word ‘[deed](## "atto")’. The meaning of ‘in [deed](## "atto")’ was ‘in fact, in truth, in reality’. Over time, the two words [merged](## "fondersi") into one, becoming ‘in[deed](## "atto")’ while retaining their meaning of affirming or [stressing](## "accentuare") a point.

## IN WRITING
Gradually, ‘in[deed](## "atto")’ started appearing in written texts. However, through the centuries it still maintained its function as an emphatic term meaning ‘without any question, in reality, [as a matter of fact](## "in realtà")’. Today it is still found in formal [settings](## "contesti"), but it is sometimes used informally too, though often ironically. It is used in written English as well as in conversation. 

## IN ADDITION
The term ‘in[deed](## "atto")’ can be placed in different places in a sentence, and its primary function has always been to emphasise the truth of a [statement](## "affermazione") or to show that the speaker strongly agrees with someone or something or confirms the information: “It is a beautiful day in[deed](## "atto").” 
The word, however, can also carry [nuanced](## "sfumati") meanings. For example, it can be used to confirm and amplify a preceding [statement](## "affermazione") by providing additional information: “He is a [skilled](## "esperto") photographer. In[deed](## "atto"), his work has been exhibited in several galleries,” or to introduce a point that’s even more true than the last one you made: “The project is challenging, in[deed](## "atto"), almost impossible.” The interjection ‘in[deed](## "atto")’ can sometimes be used to answer questions, meaning ‘yes, certainly’ or ‘yes, truly’: “Is this your first time here?” “In[deed](## "atto").” Or it can perhaps be found as an expression of surprise, incredulity, irony: “In[deed](## "atto")! I can [scarcely](## "appena") believe it.”

## IN USE
So, next time you find yourself [at a loss for words](## "senza parole"), remember the simple ‘in[deed](## "atto")’. It’s always there, ready to make you look [wise](## "saggio"), interested and [agreeable](## "gradevoli"), to make your point clear and strong, enrich your communication and help make your English sound more confident and assertive. Often, when you’re not sure what to say, ‘in[deed](## "atto")’ can be the perfect response. Just be careful not [to over-use](## "utilizzare eccessivamente") it: that can in[deed](## "atto") be counter-productive!
