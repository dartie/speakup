<p>Pink Floyd has sold over 250 million records, and “The Dark Side of the Moon” is fourth in the list of worldwide bestsellers, after Michael Jackson’s “Thriller”, AC/DC’s “Back in Black”, and the <a href="##" title="colonna sonora">soundtrack</a> to the film “The Bodyguard”.  Its iconic <a href="##" title="copertina">front cover</a>, with light refracting from a triangular prism, was created by the graphic designer Storm Thorgerson. There are only six colours, as it was thought that indigo was too similar to the black <a href="##" title="sfondo">background</a> of the album. Nowhere on the <a href="##" title="copertina">front cover</a>, back cover or the <a href="##" title="dorso">spine</a> does it say “Pink Floyd” or “The Dark Side of the Moon”.</p>

<h2 id="side-1">Side 1</h2>

<p><strong>Speak to Me:</strong> the opening track, the bass is the human heart, a metaphor for life. A roadie begins “I’ve been mad for fucking years”, setting the scene for the album’s <a href="##" title="triste">bleak</a> tone.
<strong>Breathe in the Air:</strong> is about the stresses and <a href="##" title="tensioni">strains</a> of everyday life, with the last, depressing line, “You race towards an <a href="##" title="morte prematura (lett. tomba)">early grave</a>.”
<strong>On the Run:</strong> this track was performed on a new synthesizer and featured an airport <a href="##" title="impianto audio (public address system)">PA</a> message. It was used in the NBA in Michael Jordan’s era.
<strong>Time:</strong> concentrates on the consequences of not líving life <a href="##" title="al massimo">to the full</a> — “You <a href="##" title="sciupare">fritter</a> and waste the hours &hellip; waiting for someone or something to show you the way.” The track also has one of the most famous lyrics in rock music: “<a href="##" title="tenersi stretto">Hanging on</a> in quiet desperation is the English way.”
<strong>The Great <a href="##" title="concerto">Gig</a> in the Sky:</strong> this song about mortality, features the incredible vocals of Clare Torry, who received just £30 for her contribution. She later <a href="##" title="querelare">sued</a> the band for 50 per cent of the royalties.</p>

<h2 id="side-2">Side 2</h2>

<p><strong>Money:</strong> with its famous guitar solo, <a href="##" title="prendere in giro">mocks</a> greed and consumerism: “New car, caviar, four-star daydream/Think I’ll buy me a football team/I’m in the high-fidelity, first class travelling set/And I think I need a <a href="##" title="aviogetto">Learjet</a>”.
<strong>Us and Them:</strong>mocking the idea that everything in life is black or white, the song says there can be more choices — not just ‘us’ and ‘them’.
<strong>Any Colour You Like:</strong> the final instrumental on the album — with no singing or talking — the song seems to be about life’s lack of choices.
<strong>Brain Damage:</strong> is a brutal song about isolation, paranoia and mental <a href="##" title="esaurimento">breakdown</a>, but there is also empathy and solidarity: “And if your head explodes with dark <a href="##" title="presagio">foreboding</a> too /I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon/The lunatic is in my head.”
<strong>Eclipse: </strong>the final song  features the word ‘all’ twenty times and ‘you’ eighteen times! The ‘moon’ — dangerous ideas — conquers optimism at the end.
