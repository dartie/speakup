# A Short History of Cookies   [B1]

Nel mondo anglosassone, per esempio, ci sono due tipi di biscotti: i tipici 'cookie' americani (dolci e soffici) e i 'biscuits' britannici (più sobri e asciutti). Le origini di entrambi risalgono a una millenaria ricetta asiatica di raffinazione dello zucchero.

Cookies, the [thick](## "spessa"), [chewy](## "gommosa") US version of the crunchy British biscuit, are the most-consumed snack food in the US. Americans eat more than two billion of them a year; about three hundred per person. Cookies are so popular that the north-eastern state of Massachusetts adopted the chocolate chip variety as its official state cookie in 1997. American [real estate agents](## "agenti immobiliari") have even been known to use [freshly-baked](## "appena sfornati") cookies to make houses smell [homely](## "familiare, casalingo") and encourage visitors to buy them. Along with french fries (‘chips’ in the UK), potato chips ( ‘crisps’ in the UK) and ice cream, cookies have become an American [staple](## "alimento indispensabile, classico"). But where and how were they invented? 

## oriental roots
Food historians believe that the earliest form of cookie [dates back](## "risalire") to 7th-century Persia (present-day I[ran](## "amministrare")). Persians knew how to [grow](## "coltivare") and [harvest](## "raccogliere")  [sugar cane](## "canna da zucchero")  and they used it to bake delicious cakes and [pastries](## "pasticcini"). Sugar [spread](## "diffondersi") across the whole Mediter[ran](## "amministrare")ean area, and became a luxury product in Europe. By the 14th century, cookies were [commonplace](## "común, habitual") in many European cities, and cookbooks appeared, full of recipes. One of these was Thomas Dawson’s Good [Huswife](## "casalinga (ortografia arcaica di housewife)")’s Jewell. Written for the [grow](## "coltivare")ing [yeomanry](## "classe di contadini proprietari terrieri"), or middle classes of Elizabethan England, it included a very popular recipe for a square biscuit made of [egg yolks](## "tuorli") and [spices](## "spezie"). 
 

## AN AMERICAN UPDATE
Beginning in the 17th century, [scores](## "moltitudini") of European immig[ran](## "amministrare")ts began arriving in the US, taking their customs and recipes with them. The [Dutch](## "olandese") had the koekje which is short for koek, ‘cake’. The American Cookie is a close [relative](## "parente"), and the name ‘cookie’ most likely derives from its [Dutch](## "olandese") cousin. The expansion of the railroad in the 19th century gave Americans access to many home[grow](## "coltivare")n and imported ingredients, such as [cocoa beans](## "fave di cacao"), [coconuts](## "noci di cocco"), o[ran](## "amministrare")ges and cereals. They were incorporated into many recipes, including those for cookies. 

## THE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE
The iconic chocolate chip cookie is credited to Ruth Graves Wakefield, who [ran](## "amministrare") the Toll House Restau[ran](## "amministrare")t in Whitman, Massachusetts. In 1937, Wakefield was making cookies when she realised that she had [run out](## "esaurire, rimanere senza") of baker’s chocolate, a key ingredient. Instead, she used a bar of semi-sweet chocolate [chopped](## "tagliare") into pieces, expecting it to [melt](## "fondersi") and [spread](## "diffondersi") through the cookie dough. Things didn’t go as expected, as the chocolate pieces kept their shape. The result, however, was a huge success. The recipe [spread](## "diffondersi"), and today chocolate chip cookies remain a favourite among cookie connoisseurs.
