Pink Floyd has sold over 250 million records, and “The Dark Side of the Moon” is fourth in the list of worldwide bestsellers, after Michael Jackson’s “Thriller”, AC/DC’s “Back in Black”, and the [soundtrack](## "colonna sonora") to the film “The Bodyguard”.  Its iconic [front cover](## "copertina"), with light refracting from a triangular prism, was created by the graphic designer Storm Thorgerson. There are only six colours, as it was thought that indigo was too similar to the black [background](## "sfondo") of the album. Nowhere on the [front cover](## "copertina"), back cover or the [spine](## "dorso") does it say “Pink Floyd” or “The Dark Side of the Moon”.

## Side 1
**Speak to Me:** the opening track, the bass is the human heart, a metaphor for life. A roadie begins “I’ve been mad for fucking years”, setting the scene for the album’s [bleak](## "triste") tone.
**Breathe in the Air:** is about the stresses and [strains](## "tensioni") of everyday life, with the last, depressing line, “You race towards an [early grave](## "morte prematura (lett. tomba)").”
**On the Run:** this track was performed on a new synthesizer and featured an airport [PA](## "impianto audio (public address system)") message. It was used in the NBA in Michael Jordan’s era.
**Time:** concentrates on the consequences of not líving life [to the full](## "al massimo") — “You [fritter](## "sciupare") and waste the hours ... waiting for someone or something to show you the way.” The track also has one of the most famous lyrics in rock music: “[Hanging on](## "tenersi stretto") in quiet desperation is the English way.”
**The Great [Gig](## "concerto") in the Sky:** this song about mortality, features the incredible vocals of Clare Torry, who received just £30 for her contribution. She later [sued](## "querelare") the band for 50 per cent of the royalties.

## Side 2
**Money:** with its famous guitar solo, [mocks](## "prendere in giro") greed and consumerism: “New car, caviar, four-star daydream/Think I’ll buy me a football team/I’m in the high-fidelity, first class travelling set/And I think I need a [Learjet](## "aviogetto")”.
**Us and Them:**mocking the idea that everything in life is black or white, the song says there can be more choices — not just ‘us’ and ‘them’.
**Any Colour You Like:** the final instrumental on the album — with no singing or talking — the song seems to be about life’s lack of choices.
**Brain Damage:** is a brutal song about isolation, paranoia and mental [breakdown](## "esaurimento"), but there is also empathy and solidarity: “And if your head explodes with dark [foreboding](## "presagio") too /I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon/The lunatic is in my head.”
**Eclipse: **the final song  features the word ‘all’ twenty times and ‘you’ eighteen times! The ‘moon’ — dangerous ideas — conquers optimism at the end.
