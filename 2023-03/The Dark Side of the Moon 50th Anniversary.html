<p>Pink Floyd’s album “The Dark Side of the Moon”, fifty years old this month, is a cultural <a href="##" title="pietra miliare">landmark</a>, one of the most famous records of all time. But how did an LP covering conflict, <a href="##" title="avidità">greed</a>, death, mental illness and the need for human empathy become a classic, iconic record, remaining on the US Billboard charts for 741 consecutive weeks and selling forty-five million copies? </p>

<h2 id="concept-album">Concept Album</h2>

<p>“The Dark Side of the Moon” is a real concept album, genuinely thematic, and not just a number of arbitrary songs. Roger Waters (bass guitar and vocals), wrote the lyrics: about the stresses and pressures of life, touching on wealth, armed conflict, <a href="##" title="sprecare">wasted</a> lives, mortality and madness — expressed as the dark side of the moon. The songs represent good and bad, or in Waters’ own words: “All the good things life can offer are there for us to <a href="##" title="cogliere">grasp</a>, but the influence of some dark force in our natures prevents us from <a href="##" title="afferrare">seizing</a> them.”</p>

<h2 id="many-reasons-for-success">Many Reasons for Success</h2>

<p>There are many reasons for the album’s success. The strength of the songwriting captured people’s imagination, and the lyrics were clear for both native and non-native English speakers. The <a href="##" title="abilità musicale">musicianship</a> was impeccable, especially after one year performing the songs in concert before making the record. The production, in Abbey Road Studios, was <a href="##" title="all’avanguardia">state of the art</a>, and hi-fi stereo was just becoming a mainstream consumer item — “The Dark Side of the Moon” became “one of the definitive test records that people could use on their hi-fi systems,” according to Nick Mason, the group’s drummer. People said that it was also a great record to have sex to or to listen to on stereo headphones while taking drugs!</p>

<h2 id="the-album-era">The Album Era</h2>

<p>The early 1970s were the beginning of the album era, and many record buyers were teenage boys. Waters felt that it was “the simplicity of the [album’s] ideas that <a href="##" title="rivolgersi">appeal</a> to a generation going through puberty and trying to <a href="##" title="capire, comprendere">make sense</a> of it all.” A critic a<a href="##" title="avidità">greed</a>, adding “particularly if you accept (as most women do) that most men never get much further than puberty.”</p>

<h2 id="groundbreaking-sound">Groundbreaking Sound</h2>

<p>The album became immediately famous for its <a href="##" title="rivoluzionario, all’avanguardia">groundbreaking</a> sound. There were synthesizers making helicopter noises, phrases added between tracks using the voices of the group’s <a href="##" title="tecnici del suono">roadies</a> and the Abbey Road studio staff, and clocks recorded in an antique <a href="##" title="di orologi">timepiece</a> shop.</p>

<h2 id="pivotal-moment">Pivotal Moment</h2>

<p>The release of “The Dark Side of the Moon” is often seen as a <a href="##" title="momento cruciale">pivotal moment</a> in the history of rock music. It marked a high point in the album era. The record made the group members — Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright and Nick Mason — extremely rich. It also helped increase album sales generally. The LP is eternally popular, selling 250,000 copies a year. Its 50th anniversary will take sales near the fifty-million-copies mark.
