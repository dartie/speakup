Pink Floyd’s album “The Dark Side of the Moon”, fifty years old this month, is a cultural [landmark](## "pietra miliare"), one of the most famous records of all time. But how did an LP covering conflict, [greed](## "avidità"), death, mental illness and the need for human empathy become a classic, iconic record, remaining on the US Billboard charts for 741 consecutive weeks and selling forty-five million copies? 

## Concept Album
“The Dark Side of the Moon” is a real concept album, genuinely thematic, and not just a number of arbitrary songs. Roger Waters (bass guitar and vocals), wrote the lyrics: about the stresses and pressures of life, touching on wealth, armed conflict, [wasted](## "sprecare") lives, mortality and madness — expressed as the dark side of the moon. The songs represent good and bad, or in Waters’ own words: “All the good things life can offer are there for us to [grasp](## "cogliere"), but the influence of some dark force in our natures prevents us from [seizing](## "afferrare") them.”

## Many Reasons for Success
There are many reasons for the album’s success. The strength of the songwriting captured people’s imagination, and the lyrics were clear for both native and non-native English speakers. The [musicianship](## "abilità musicale") was impeccable, especially after one year performing the songs in concert before making the record. The production, in Abbey Road Studios, was [state of the art](## "all’avanguardia"), and hi-fi stereo was just becoming a mainstream consumer item — “The Dark Side of the Moon” became “one of the definitive test records that people could use on their hi-fi systems,” according to Nick Mason, the group’s drummer. People said that it was also a great record to have sex to or to listen to on stereo headphones while taking drugs!

## The Album Era
The early 1970s were the beginning of the album era, and many record buyers were teenage boys. Waters felt that it was “the simplicity of the [album’s] ideas that [appeal](## "rivolgersi") to a generation going through puberty and trying to [make sense](## "capire, comprendere") of it all.” A critic a[greed](## "avidità"), adding “particularly if you accept (as most women do) that most men never get much further than puberty.”

## Groundbreaking Sound
The album became immediately famous for its [groundbreaking](## "rivoluzionario, all’avanguardia") sound. There were synthesizers making helicopter noises, phrases added between tracks using the voices of the group’s [roadies](## "tecnici del suono") and the Abbey Road studio staff, and clocks recorded in an antique [timepiece](## "di orologi") shop.

## Pivotal Moment
The release of “The Dark Side of the Moon” is often seen as a [pivotal moment](## "momento cruciale") in the history of rock music. It marked a high point in the album era. The record made the group members — Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright and Nick Mason — extremely rich. It also helped increase album sales generally. The LP is eternally popular, selling 250,000 copies a year. Its 50th anniversary will take sales near the fifty-million-copies mark.
