# Watergate: 50th Anniversary   [B2]

Nel 1972, l’irruzione di alcuni sconosciuti nella sede principale del Comitato Nazionale Democratico portò a due anni di indagini che rivelarono una serie di abusi di potere da parte della Casa Bianca dell’allora Presidente Richard Nixon.

On 17 June 1972, night security guard Frank Wills [noticed](## "notare") a piece of [tape](## "nastro adesivo") [stuck](## "pegar, enganchar") to the [latch](## "serratura") of a [basement](## "seminterrato") door at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. He [removed](## "rimuovere") the [tape](## "nastro adesivo"), which was holding the door open, but on his next round it had reappeared. In response to his call, two policemen [in plain clothing](## "in borghese") [turned up](## "presentarsi") and caught five men in the act of an apparent robbery.

## THE POST
Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two young reporters at The Washington Post, [picked up](## "prendere, raccogliere") the story and refused to [let it go](## "lasciare andare"). With the help of an anonymous informant they called Deep Throat, and with the guidance and backing of their senior colleagues, Bernstein and Woodward began to uncover an [earth-shattering](## "sconvolgente, dirompente") truth. With revelation after revelation, they became convinced that US President Richard Nixon was [engaging](## "partecipare") in criminal activity. 

## CONGRESS
As things heated up, Nixon and his men took steps to cover up their involvement in the [break-in](## "irruzione"). The President’s [landslide](## "schiacciante") re-election in November 1973 appeared to show that, despite the mounting evidence against him, the American public [still trusted](## "fidarsi") him. However, [mainstream media outlets](## "principali fonti di comunicazione") were publicising the story, and Congress launched its own internal investigation with [bipartisan support](## "sostegno bipartitico"). 

## WITNESSES
Over the course of a year, key witnesses testified to an [array](## "serie") of clandestine and illegal activities [undertaken](## "intraprendere") by members of the Nixon administration. These included [bugging](## "intercettare") the offices of opponents, ordering investigations of activist groups, and using the FBI, the CIA and the [IRS](## "agenzia delle entrate (Internal Revenue Service)") as political weapons to protect the presidency. Finally, in August 1974, leading figures in the Republican Party put pressure on Nixon to resign, which led to him being the first and only US president to do so. Fifty years on, The Washington Post maintains an[outstanding](## "eccezionale") reputation, and Watergate remains a symbol of investigative reporting worldwide, [so much so](## "a tal punto") that the suffix ‘-gate’ is used to describe political scandals everywhere.
