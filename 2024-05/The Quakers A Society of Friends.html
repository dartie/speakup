<p>La comunità, che si è dissociata dalla Chiesa anglicana, pratica uno stile di vita austero. Il suo nome in inglese deriva dal verbo ‘quake’, un riferimento all’insegnamento del suo fondatore di “tremare davanti a Dio”.</p>

<p>Also called the Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers are a religious community with a history dating back to the 17th century. The movement originated in England and was founded by George Fox, who intended to go back to the <a href="##" title="radici">roots</a> of Christianity and to Jesus’ teachings of non-violence, simple living and <a href="##" title="interesse, preoccupazione">concern</a> for those in need. Quakers gained a considerable following, which quickly <a href="##" title="diffondersi">spread</a> to American colonies and to various parts of the world. Members of this movement (called “The Friends”) played a significant role in the abolition of slavery and were among the earliest <a href="##" title="sostenitori">advocates</a> of women’s rights. They are also known for their humanitarian work, <a href="##" title="affrontare">addressing</a> issues such as poverty, public education and healthcare.</p>

<h2 id="quakers-today">QUAKERS TODAY</h2>

<p>Today there are an estimated 370,000 society members worldwide, in over eighty different countries. The majority however are in Africa and the Americas, with almost a hundred thousand members in the United States. Kenya has the largest number of Quakers in a single nation.</p>

<h2 id="customs-and-beliefs">CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS</h2>

<p>Central to Quakers&rsquo; <a href="##" title="credenze, convinzioni">beliefs</a> is the presence of an <a href="##" title="luce interiore">inner light</a> within each individual, a direct connection to God that guides them in their spiritual journey. Quaker <a href="##" title="culto">worship</a> is simple and takes place in silence: no one speaks <a href="##" title="a meno che non">unless</a><a href="##" title="spronato da">moved to by</a> God, then they may share their thoughts with others. When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. Decisions are made collectively without a designated leader and everyone has an equal voice. Quakers have peace-oriented values, are active in civil rights movements and reject participation in wars. They emphasise simplicity and equality, extending these principles to their lifestyle choices as well.</p>

<h2 id="quaker-joke">QUAKER JOKE</h2>

<p>More than just a set of <a href="##" title="credenze, convinzioni">beliefs</a>, Quakerism is a way of life. Quakers today don’t look any different from other people, even though they tend to avoid excess and have a reflective, meditative and peaceful conduct. These <a href="##" title="caratteristiche">traits</a> have <a href="##" title="perdurare">endured</a> for 370 years and, inevitably, have inspired plenty of jokes, like Woody Allen’s line in Sleeper (1973): “I’m telling you. You got the wrong man. I’m not the heroic type. Really. I was <a href="##" title="picchiare, menare">beaten up</a> by Quakers.”  </p>

<h2 id="famous-friends">FAMOUS FRIENDS</h2>

<p>Famous Quakers or people who were raised as Quakers include Richard Nixon, who married in a Quaker ceremony in California; Joan Baez, who grew up in a Quaker family (her father, a physicist, refused to work on the atomic bomb project in Los Alamos); the Cadbury family, who believing that alcohol would only <a href="##" title="peggiorare">worsen</a> society&rsquo;s problems, decided to focus their business on chocolate as a welcome alternative; James Dean, who was raised a Quaker and is today buried in a Quaker cemetery; and actress Judi Dench, who converted to Quakerism after attending a Friends school, <a href="##" title="a quanto si dice">reportedly</a> because she loved the school uniforms.
