<p>From his <a href="##" title="umili">humble</a> beginnings as the sixth child of a Norfolk <a href="##" title="ecclesiastico">clergyman</a>, Horatio Nelson <a href="##" title="ascendere">rose</a> to become one of the greatest figures in British military history. His brilliant victories over the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte, and his <a href="##" title="irremovibile">uncompromising</a> courage, despite his disabilities, have established him as a symbol of national identity.  </p>

<h2 id="childhood-in-the-navy">CHILDHOOD IN THE NAVY</h2>

<p>Nelson was born on 29 September 1758. Aged twelve, he joined the navy as an apprentice, and was <a href="##" title="che ha il mal di mare">seasick</a> on his first day. In fact, he suffered from <a href="##" title="che ha il mal di mare">seasick</a>ness all his life! Made captain at just twenty, Nelson spent his first service managing Britain’s commercial interests — including slavery — in the <a href="##" title="Indie occidentali">West Indies</a>. In 1787, he married Fanny Nisbet, a judge’s daughter, in the Caribbean. </p>

<h2 id="britain-at-war">BRITAIN AT WAR</h2>

<p>In 1793, Britain entered the French Revolutionary Wars. These were conflicts between France, allied with Spain, and other European countries, including Britain, resulting from the French Revolution. Now in command of the <a href="##" title="nave di sua maestà ('His Majesty’s Ship')">HMS</a>Agamemnon, Nelson served in the Mediterranean, and would help Britain establish naval superiority over the French and Spanish <a href="##" title="flotte">fleets</a>. </p>

<h2 id="war-wounds">WAR WOUNDS</h2>

<p>At the Battle of Calvi in 1794, Nelson lost the sight in his right eye. In 1797, he was <a href="##" title="nominare cavaliere">knighted</a> after his major role in the British victory at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. A few months later, at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, <a href="##" title="chirurghi">surgeons</a> had to amputate his badly <a href="##" title="ferire">wounded</a> right arm, without anaesthetics. He only <a href="##" title="lamentarsi">complained</a> that the <a href="##" title="chirurghi">surgeons</a>’ knives were too cold!</p>

<h2 id="the-battle-of-the-nile">THE BATTLE OF THE NILE</h2>

<p>Nelson went on to win a famous victory at the Battle of the Nile in 1798, destroying Napoleon’s fleet in a <a href="##" title="audace">daring</a> manoeuvre where he attacked unexpectedly from the <a href="##" title="stretto tratto d’acqua">narrow stretch of water</a> between the French ships and the shore, with the land only metres away and at the risk of the English ships running aground. The French suffered thousands of <a href="##" title="perdite">casualties</a>, and Nelson stopped Napoleon’s attempt to create a direct trade route to India, protecting Britain’s growing empire. 
Nelson was then <a href="##" title="assegnare, designare">posted</a> to Naples, where he met and fell in love with Lady Emma Hamilton, wife of the ambassador, Sir William Hamilton. The couple moved to England in 1803 and lived together openly — along with Emma’s <a href="##" title="anziano">aged</a> husband. Nelson ignored the monumental scandal, even having a baby with Emma.</p>

<h2 id="trafalgar">TRAFALGAR</h2>

<p>In 1803 the so-called Napoleonic Wars <a href="##" title="scoppiare">broke out</a> between Napoleon’s France (again allied with Spain) and various European countries. Nelson, now a vice-admiral and a <a href="##" title="visconte">viscount</a>, was made commander-in-chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet. Napoleon started to prepare an enormous force in northern France to invade England. On 21 October 1805, the British fleet eng<a href="##" title="anziano">aged</a> the French and Spanish ships at the Battle of Trafalgar, <a href="##" title="di fronte alle coste di Cadice">off Cadiz</a> in the south of Spain. Nelson, on <a href="##" title="nave di sua maestà ('His Majesty’s Ship')">HMS</a> Victory, won a famous victory, destroying the enemy <a href="##" title="flotte">fleets</a> and forcing Napoleon <a href="##" title="annullare">to call off</a> the invasion. </p>

<h2 id="nelson-s-column">NELSON’S COLUMN</h2>

<p>Tragically, though, Nelson was killed in the battle by a fatal gunshot wound. His death provoked <a href="##" title="lutto, dolore">grief</a> on a scale never seen before in Britain, and his <a href="##" title="prodezze">feats</a> quickly entered British folklore. Today Nelson appears immortalised in stone on the top of Nelson’s Column, a fifty-two-metre-high monument in Trafalgar Square in Central London. With a bird’s-eye view of the British capital, Nelson <a href="##" title="ergersi">stands tall</a> as one of Britain’s great national heroes.  </p>
