<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: So, I think it’s time <a href="##" title="gestire">I managed</a> my finances more pro-actively.
<strong>Alex</strong>: Have your circumstances changed?
<strong>Charlie</strong>: I’ve just started a good job with a much higher salary.
<strong>Alex</strong>: Congratulations! Let’s start with debt: do you have any? Any student loans still outstanding?
<strong>Charlie</strong>: No, nothing but the mortgage on my flat.
<strong>Alex</strong>: OK. Now tell me, how do you spend your <a href="##" title="guadagno">income</a>?
<strong>Charlie</strong>: <a href="##" title="le solite cose">The usual stuff</a>: the mortgage, <a href="##" title="bollette di luce e gas">utility bills</a>, food, going out, holidays
<strong>Alex</strong>: Do you put any aside for the future?
<strong>Charlie</strong>: Yes, I put a fixed amount in a high-interest savings account.
<strong>Alex</strong>: That’s good. What about <a href="##" title="investimenti">investments</a> or a pension plan?
Charlie: No, nothing like that. I don’t like taking risks and I’m not that old.
<strong>Alex</strong>: Oh, but <a href="##" title="quanto prima">the sooner</a> you start, the better off you’ll be when you retire.
<strong>Charlie</strong>: I guess so.
<strong>Alex</strong>: Also, there are investment products for people with a low risk profile. You should make your money work for you.
<strong>Charlie</strong>: That sounds good. Please talk me through the options.</p>

<h2 id="now-let-s-review-the-vocabulary">NOW  LET’S  REVIEW THE  VOCABULARY!</h2>

<p>When you manage a situation, rather than responding to it when it becomes necessary, you are being ‘<strong>pro-active</strong>’ (instead of ‘reactive’).
‘<strong>Circumstances</strong>’ refer to the conditions of a person’s life, in this case, employment.
‘<strong>Debt</strong>’ is the money that you <a href="##" title="dovere">owe</a>.
‘<strong>Nothing but</strong>’ is the same as ‘only’.
In finance, ‘<strong>outstanding</strong>’ means ‘<a href="##" title="non ancora">not yet</a> paid’.
A ‘<strong>mortgage</strong>’ is a long-term loan for buying a property.
The phrasal verb ‘<strong>to put aside</strong>’ means ‘to save’ (money).
A ‘<strong>fixed amount</strong>’ is a sum of money that is the same for every payment, for example, £100 a month.
A ‘<strong>high-interest savings account</strong>’ is a bank account specifically for saving money, which pays a higher-than-average <a href="##" title="tasso di interesse">interest rate</a>.
‘Better off’ means ‘<strong>in a more favourable position</strong>’, often regarding money.
‘<strong>To retire’</strong> is to stop working due to old age or illness.
A ‘<strong>risk profile</strong>’ is an assessment of a person’s willingness to take risks when investing money.
‘<strong>To talk someone through</strong>’ (the options) means to explain all the details to them.</p>
