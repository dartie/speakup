**Charlie**: So, I think it’s time [I managed](## "gestire") my finances more pro-actively.
**Alex**: Have your circumstances changed?
**Charlie**: I’ve just started a good job with a much higher salary.
**Alex**: Congratulations! Let’s start with debt: do you have any? Any student loans still outstanding?
**Charlie**: No, nothing but the mortgage on my flat.
**Alex**: OK. Now tell me, how do you spend your [income](## "guadagno")?
**Charlie**: [The usual stuff](## "le solite cose"): the mortgage, [utility bills](## "bollette di luce e gas"), food, going out, holidays
**Alex**: Do you put any aside for the future?
**Charlie**: Yes, I put a fixed amount in a high-interest savings account.
**Alex**: That’s good. What about [investments](## "investimenti") or a pension plan?
Charlie: No, nothing like that. I don’t like taking risks and I’m not that old.
**Alex**: Oh, but [the sooner](## "quanto prima") you start, the better off you’ll be when you retire.
**Charlie**: I guess so.
**Alex**: Also, there are investment products for people with a low risk profile. You should make your money work for you.
**Charlie**: That sounds good. Please talk me through the options.

## NOW  LET’S  REVIEW THE  VOCABULARY!
When you manage a situation, rather than responding to it when it becomes necessary, you are being ‘**pro-active**’ (instead of ‘reactive’).
‘**Circumstances**’ refer to the conditions of a person’s life, in this case, employment.
‘**Debt**’ is the money that you [owe](## "dovere").
‘**Nothing but**’ is the same as ‘only’.
In finance, ‘**outstanding**’ means ‘[not yet](## "non ancora") paid’.
A ‘**mortgage**’ is a long-term loan for buying a property.
The phrasal verb ‘**to put aside**’ means ‘to save’ (money).
A ‘**fixed amount**’ is a sum of money that is the same for every payment, for example, £100 a month.
A ‘**high-interest savings account**’ is a bank account specifically for saving money, which pays a higher-than-average [interest rate](## "tasso di interesse").
‘Better off’ means ‘**in a more favourable position**’, often regarding money.
‘**To retire’** is to stop working due to old age or illness.
A ‘**risk profile**’ is an assessment of a person’s willingness to take risks when investing money.
‘**To talk someone through**’ (the options) means to explain all the details to them.
