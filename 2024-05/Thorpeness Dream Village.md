# Thorpeness: Dream Village   [B2]

La regione dell’Anglia Orientale è famosa per i suoi pittoreschi paesaggi costieri, ma Thorpeness è unico nel suo genere: frutto dell’ingegno di un uomo, questo piccolo villaggio di pescatori è stato trasformato in una favolosa destinazione turistica.

If you could [dream a village into existence](## "trasformare un sogno in realtà, far avverare un sogno"), what would it look like? Perhaps something like the seaside village of Thorpeness in Suffolk. [Framed](## "incorniciato") by [heathland](## "lande"), [sandy beaches](## "spiagge di sabbia") and the sea, Thorpeness features beautiful [timbered and brick](## "in legno e mattoni") buildings, waterfront bungalows and a [windmill](## "mulino a vento"), plus a tearoom, pub and local shops. At its heart is an expansive and delightful boating lake called the Meare.

## INHERITANCE
In 1910, Glencairn Stuart Ogilvie, a wealthy [barrister](## "avvocato"), [playwright](## "drammaturgo") and architect, looked out onto the [puddled](## "fangoso, paludoso") landscape around the tiny fishing [hamlet](## "borgo, paesino") of Thorpe. Ogilvie had inherited the 2,400-hectare (24 sq. km) [estate](## "tenuta") on the Suffolk coast, but the [encroaching](## "invadere") North Sea was threatening to submerge it. Now, he had to decide whether to abandon Thorpe, or save it for the future. Ogilvie decided he would build an exclusive holiday village. He renamed the village Thorpeness to distinguish it from the many other villages called Thorpe in the country.

## PETER PAN
With the help of a large team of skilled workers, Ogilvie built [mock-Tudor](## "finto stile Tudor") and Jacobean houses, bungalows, a boathouse, golf course, tennis courts,[bowling green](## "campo da bocce") and a country club called the Kursaal. The Crown Inn was renovated and renamed the Dolphin Hotel. The Meare, once an [inlet](## "insenatura") on Suffolk’s Hundred River that provided [shelter](## "rifugio") for ships, had [silted up](## "diventare fangoso") over the centuries. Ogilvie decided to transform it into a [shallow](## "poco profondo") boating lake. The author J. M. Barrie was a family friend, so tiny islands were created inspired by his children’s book Peter Pan. A water tower was refashioned into a wooden house on a high [plinth](## "piedistallo") and named the House in the Clouds, and the transformation of Thorpeness into a [fairytale](## "da favola") resort was complete. 

## IDEALISM
Ogilvie followed what were known as the ‘garden city’ ideals of urban planner Ebeneezer Howard. Howard wanted to create a place for people to live healthy lives in harmony with nature. Ogilvie hoped that Thorpeness would help visitors and residents become citizens who were “kind, generous, polite, energetic, moral, nationalistic, intellectual, comfort-loving and [fond of](## "essere affezionato a") beauty.” He was certainly ambitious!
Ogilvie died in 1932, but would be pleased to know that Thorpeness remains a genteel holiday paradise for children and their families. As well as taking a [rowing boat](## "barca a remi") on the Meare, or enjoying the annual regatta with fireworks and festivities, visitors can enjoy ice creams, [cream teas](## "tè del pomeriggio"), antiques, walking, cycling and [wildlife-spotting](## "avvistamento di fauna") here on the [unspoiled](## "incontaminata") Suffolk coast.
