Kris: Hey men, good to see you!
Noam: You, too, old chap!
Kris: Old chap’? You been watching that British TV series again, you anglophile?
Noam: Bloody hell, stop giving me grief!
Kris: All right, all right. So, [what’s new](## "cosa c’è di nuovo?") ?
Noam: Well, remember that girl I fancied?
Kris: Yeah, what about her?
Noam: I asked her out and she said yes. I was [gob](## "becco")[smacked](## "schiaffeggiare")!
Kris: What, she hit you in the face?
Noam: No, you cheeky sod, you know what I mean.
Kris: Too right, gov’nor!
Noam: Stop taking the piss, you twit.
Kris: Oh, come on, you’re asking for it. So, when are you going out?
Noam: In a fortnight.
Kris: What’s the video game got to do with it?
Noam: Nothing, we’re meeting in two weeks’ time.
Kris: Well, just say so, then.
Noam: Anyway, I’m well chuffed. But I must dash. See you soon.
Kris: Sure, dude. Toodle pip!
Noam: Argh! Tosser…
