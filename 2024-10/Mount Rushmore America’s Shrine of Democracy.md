The Mount Rushmore National Memorial, [nestled](## "annidato") in the granite stone of the Black Hills of South Dakota, stands as a monumental tribute to four of the most influential presidents in United States history. Renowned as America’s [Shrine](## "santuario") of Democracy, it [features](## "presentare") the eighteen-metre-high faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. 
The [inception](## "principio, inizio") of Mount Rushmore began with a vision by South Dakota historian Doane Robinson, who initially proposed a monument featuring Western heroes such as Buffalo Bill or the formidable warrior chief Red Cloud. However, the sculptor Gutzon Borglum chose to immortalise four US presidents as a monument that would appeal to all Americans. Borglum’s selection was symbolic: George Washington, the nation’s founding father and Revolutionary War hero, represented the birth of the United States; Thomas Jefferson was chosen for his role in the nation’s expansion; Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery and preserved the Union during the Civil War, stood for unity and equality; and Theodore Roosevelt symbolised the modern development of the country.
Construction of the Mount Rushmore Memorial began on** ** 4 October 1927. Under Borglum’s direction, a team of forty men dynamited the rocks and used [power tools](## "utensili elettrici") [to carve](## "scolpire") the heads of the presidents into the mountain. But the project faced numerous [setbacks](## "contrattempi"), including severe weather conditions and financial [constraints](## "limiti")[due to](## "dovuto a") the Great Depression and the [outbreak](## "scoppio") of World War Two.
After nearly fourteen years of work, Gutzon Borglum died while [en route to](## "dirigersi a") Washington to [secure](## "ottenere") additional [funding](## "finanziamenti"). His son, Lincoln Borglum, [took over](## "prendere, assumere") and finally completed the monument on 31 October 1941, just a few months after his father’s death.
