# Fall Foliage: US Nature   [B2]

Con l’arrivo dell’autunno, le foreste decidue degli Stati Uniti offrono uno spettacolo naturale caratterizzato da un’esplosione di variazioni cromatiche destinata a durare solo per un periodo limitato.

It’s [leaf-peeping](## "spiare le foglie") season! As the days get shorter, nature puts on a spectacular show in many parts of the United States, drawing thousands of admirers to the country’s national parks. The leaves on the trees begin to change colour, from green to red, orange and gold. All across the northern states, the forests [put on a magnificent display](## "mettere in mostra") of [fiery](## "focose") [hues](## "tonalità"). 

## DECIDUOUS TREES
Not all trees change colour, as some are [evergreen](## "sempreverdi"). These trees are always green, but lose their leaves at different times of the year. [Deciduous](## "decidui") trees lose their leaves in the fall to conserve energy. Common species in the US include [oak](## "quercia"), [birch](## "betulla") and [beech](## "faggio"). These trees have broad leaves that put the different shades on display before they drop off and leave the trees [bare](## "spogli") for winter. Fall colours become gradually visible through the green, as the colder weather slows down the production of chlorophyll.

## CHANGING SEASONS
[Deciduous](## "decidui") forests are one of the three biomes in the US, along with [grasslands](## "praterie") and deserts. [Deciduous](## "decidui") forest biomes primarily [stretch up](## "estendersi") the East Coast, from Florida to Maine, but also spread across the Midwest and into parts of Texas. Temperature variations and moderate rainfall make them rich in biodiversity. Animal life is another reason to visit these forests in the fall: the forests attract a lot of birdlife, as well as [deer](## "cervi"), [raccoons](## "procioni"), [opossums](## "didelfidi"), [porcupines](## "istrici") and red foxes — all have adapted to survive the four distinct seasons.
