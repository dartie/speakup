<p>The Mount Rushmore National Memorial, <a href="##" title="annidato">nestled</a> in the granite stone of the Black Hills of South Dakota, stands as a monumental tribute to four of the most influential presidents in United States history. Renowned as America’s <a href="##" title="santuario">Shrine</a> of Democracy, it <a href="##" title="presentare">features</a> the eighteen-metre-high faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. 
The <a href="##" title="principio, inizio">inception</a> of Mount Rushmore began with a vision by South Dakota historian Doane Robinson, who initially proposed a monument featuring Western heroes such as Buffalo Bill or the formidable warrior chief Red Cloud. However, the sculptor Gutzon Borglum chose to immortalise four US presidents as a monument that would appeal to all Americans. Borglum’s selection was symbolic: George Washington, the nation’s founding father and Revolutionary War hero, represented the birth of the United States; Thomas Jefferson was chosen for his role in the nation’s expansion; Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery and preserved the Union during the Civil War, stood for unity and equality; and Theodore Roosevelt symbolised the modern development of the country.
Construction of the Mount Rushmore Memorial began on<strong> </strong> 4 October 1927. Under Borglum’s direction, a team of forty men dynamited the rocks and used <a href="##" title="utensili elettrici">power tools</a> <a href="##" title="scolpire">to carve</a> the heads of the presidents into the mountain. But the project faced numerous <a href="##" title="contrattempi">setbacks</a>, including severe weather conditions and financial <a href="##" title="limiti">constraints</a><a href="##" title="dovuto a">due to</a> the Great Depression and the <a href="##" title="scoppio">outbreak</a> of World War Two.
After nearly fourteen years of work, Gutzon Borglum died while <a href="##" title="dirigersi a">en route to</a> Washington to <a href="##" title="ottenere">secure</a> additional <a href="##" title="finanziamenti">funding</a>. His son, Lincoln Borglum, <a href="##" title="prendere, assumere">took over</a> and finally completed the monument on 31 October 1941, just a few months after his father’s death.  </p>
