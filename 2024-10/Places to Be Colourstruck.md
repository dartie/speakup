The progression of fall foliage is impossible to predict with [accuracy](## "precisione"). To catch the leaves at the peak of their colour, the weather conditions need to be right. Rain will leave the leaves wet and [soggy](## "inzuppate"), while strong wind can make them fall sooner than expected. Mid-October is generally peak time to view the fall colours, and some places are good to visit no matter the time of year. Here are some of the best places to admire the autumn colours.

## 1. SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK (VIRGINIA)
This long and narrow park runs along the Blue Ridge Mountains, 120km from Washington. It is famous for its autumn colours, when the [rolling hills](## "colline ondeggianti") are covered in [crimson](## "cremisi")[maple](## "aceri") leaves. Visitors can drive or [hike](## "fare una camminata") along a network of [trails](## "sentieri"), which include a section of the long-distance Appalachian Trail. Besides its [wetlands](## "terreni acquitrinosi"), [waterfalls](## "cascate") and rocky mountain peaks, the park is home to many birds, [deer](## "cervi"), [squirrels](## "scoiattoli") and even black bears.

## 2. BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY
(NORTH CAROLINA & VIRGINIA)
Known as ‘America’s Favourite Drive’, the Blue Ridge Parkway is famed for its scenic beauty. It links Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains National Parks and is the perfect route to admire the fall foliage from the comfort of a vehicle, stopping at [trails](## "sentieri"), [waterfalls](## "cascate") and [overlooks](## "punti panoramici") along the way. Starting in the highest parts, the colours change throughout the month of October. A host of wildflowers are [in bloom](## "in fiore") in addition to over a hundred species of native trees.

## 3. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK (COLORADO)
One of the highest national parks in the US, Rocky Mountain National Park [straddles](## "stare a cavalcioni di") the Continental Divide. When the [aspen trees](## "pioppi tremuli") turn to gold, visitors follow the colours from the alpine into the montane zone. The aspens begin to change colour at higher elevations in early September; lower down, they change from mid- to late September. Autumn is also the time of the [elk](## "wapiti, alci") [rut](## "calore"). Elk leave the high country and arrive on the plains to begin their [mating](## "accoppiamento") season.

## 4. GLACIER NATIONAL PARK (MONTANA)
More adventurous visitors should [head for](## "recarsi, dirigersi") Glacier National Park. The large wilderness area features [glacier-carved](## "scolpite dai ghiacciai") peaks and valleys under a vivid blue sky. The colder weather means that leaves begin to change early, some time in mid-September. They change by the hour, until the last colour change in mid-October, when the [larch trees](## "larici") turn gold. It is also a good time to see local wildlife prepare for winter, including bears.

## 5. GUADALUPE MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK (TEXAS)
The leaves in Guadalupe mountains are among the last to change colour, from mid-October to mid-November. The higher elevations allow [maple](## "aceri")s and other deciduous trees to grow in the vast Chihuahuan Desert of western Texas. Hiking the park [trails](## "sentieri") is the best way to enjoy the colours. In McKittrick and Dog Canyons, the reds, oranges and yellows contrast against the grey [cliffs](## "scogliere"). It is the last chance to catch the fall foliage, before the cold winds of winter put an end to the show.
