<p>Fifty years ago, The Texas <a href="##" title="motosega">Chain Saw</a> Massacre, one of the most influential films in Hollywood history, <a href="##" title="arrivare sugli schermi cinematografici">hit cinema screens</a>, shocking people around the world and influencing the genre for decades to come. Even the slasher film poster’s <a href="##" title="sangue che cola">blood-dripping</a> message was designed to disturb: “Who will survive and what will be left of them?”</p>

<h2 id="trespassers-will-be-eaten">TRESPASSERS WILL BE EATEN</h2>

<p>The film’s plot was simple: a group of sadistic, <a href="##" title="tombaroli">grave-robbing</a> cannibals torture, kill and eat <a href="##" title="intrusi">trespassers</a>. To add a little <a href="##" title="carne">flesh</a> to these bones: the film is described on the website Rotten Tomatoes as being about a group of hippies who travel to an old farmhouse, where they discover crazed, murderous <a href="##" title="emarginati">out<a href="##" title="attori">cast</a>s</a> living next door. The group is then attacked one by one by a man in a mask made of human skin — Leatherface — <a href="##" title="brandire">wielding</a> a chainsaw.    </p>

<h2 id="stunning-success">STUNNING SUCCESS</h2>

<p>The film was an immediate success in the US, making today’s equivalent of $150 million. Now considered a classic, one of the scariest films ever made, reviews at the time were mixed. The LA Times simply called it “<a href="##" title="disprezzabile">despicable</a>.” Other critics <a href="##" title="elogiare">praised</a> its aesthetic quality and power, although reviews could be confusing, with one journalist calling it a “masterpiece of fear and <a href="##" title="odio, disgusto">loathing</a>.” </p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-the-film">THE POWER OF THE FILM</h2>

<p>The film’s power came from three sources. The horror and <a href="##" title="sangue">gore</a> are mostly suggested and felt rather than seen. The film creates a claustrophobic atmosphere of madness, threat and imminent violence, but there is little explicit detail. The tone was deeply disturbing, said one critic: “The driving force is total <a href="##" title="follia, pazzia">insanity</a>.” The film’s makers also scared people by claiming that the movie was based in true events — in fact, the movie did have elements of the shocking story of the 1950s serial murderer Ed Gein. The film was also received as a social commentary on the political climate of the time.</p>

<h2 id="horrific-filming">HORRIFIC FILMING</h2>

<p>Making the film in Texas in the summer was a nightmare. With a budget of just $140,000, the <a href="##" title="attori">cast</a> of unknowns filmed sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. The farmhouse <a href="##" title="mobili">furniture</a> was made of animal bones and latex, and the crew covered the walls with blood from the local <a href="##" title="macello, mattatoio">abattoir</a> and decorated the floor with animal remains. Some of the actors’ blood in the film was actually real as the stage blood tubes proved <a href="##" title="difettose">faulty</a> In one scene, featuring the chainsaw, an actor was told to stay still or die! In the final torture scene, filmed over twenty-six hours in 46° C (with <a href="##" title="maleodorante">foul-smelling</a> actors in their costumes, with dead animal parts and fetid cheese for atmosphere), the <a href="##" title="attori">cast</a> took breaks to vomit outside.</p>

<h2 id="influential-movie">INFLUENTIAL MOVIE</h2>

<p>Co-written and directed by Tobe Hooper, The Texas <a href="##" title="motosega">Chain Saw</a> Massacre was enormously influential. It originated several elements in the slasher genre, including the use of <a href="##" title="utensili elettrici">power tools</a> as murder weapons, the killer as a large, silent, masked figure, <a href="##" title="priva">devoid</a> of personality, and the sadistic killing of victims. The film’s roots can be seen in numerous classic movies, including Halloween, The Evil Dead, The Blair Witch Project and The Silence of the <a href="##" title="agnelli">Lambs</a>.  </p>
