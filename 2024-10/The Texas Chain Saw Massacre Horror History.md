Fifty years ago, The Texas [Chain Saw](## "motosega") Massacre, one of the most influential films in Hollywood history, [hit cinema screens](## "arrivare sugli schermi cinematografici"), shocking people around the world and influencing the genre for decades to come. Even the slasher film poster’s [blood-dripping](## "sangue che cola") message was designed to disturb: “Who will survive and what will be left of them?”

## TRESPASSERS WILL BE EATEN
The film’s plot was simple: a group of sadistic, [grave-robbing](## "tombaroli") cannibals torture, kill and eat [trespassers](## "intrusi"). To add a little [flesh](## "carne") to these bones: the film is described on the website Rotten Tomatoes as being about a group of hippies who travel to an old farmhouse, where they discover crazed, murderous [out[cast](## "attori")s](## "emarginati") living next door. The group is then attacked one by one by a man in a mask made of human skin — Leatherface — [wielding](## "brandire") a chainsaw.    

## STUNNING SUCCESS
The film was an immediate success in the US, making today’s equivalent of $150 million. Now considered a classic, one of the scariest films ever made, reviews at the time were mixed. The LA Times simply called it “[despicable](## "disprezzabile").” Other critics [praised](## "elogiare") its aesthetic quality and power, although reviews could be confusing, with one journalist calling it a “masterpiece of fear and [loathing](## "odio, disgusto").” 

## THE POWER OF THE FILM
The film’s power came from three sources. The horror and [gore](## "sangue") are mostly suggested and felt rather than seen. The film creates a claustrophobic atmosphere of madness, threat and imminent violence, but there is little explicit detail. The tone was deeply disturbing, said one critic: “The driving force is total [insanity](## "follia, pazzia").” The film’s makers also scared people by claiming that the movie was based in true events — in fact, the movie did have elements of the shocking story of the 1950s serial murderer Ed Gein. The film was also received as a social commentary on the political climate of the time.

## HORRIFIC FILMING
Making the film in Texas in the summer was a nightmare. With a budget of just $140,000, the [cast](## "attori") of unknowns filmed sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. The farmhouse [furniture](## "mobili") was made of animal bones and latex, and the crew covered the walls with blood from the local [abattoir](## "macello, mattatoio") and decorated the floor with animal remains. Some of the actors’ blood in the film was actually real as the stage blood tubes proved [faulty](## "difettose") In one scene, featuring the chainsaw, an actor was told to stay still or die! In the final torture scene, filmed over twenty-six hours in 46° C (with [foul-smelling](## "maleodorante") actors in their costumes, with dead animal parts and fetid cheese for atmosphere), the [cast](## "attori") took breaks to vomit outside.

## INFLUENTIAL MOVIE
Co-written and directed by Tobe Hooper, The Texas [Chain Saw](## "motosega") Massacre was enormously influential. It originated several elements in the slasher genre, including the use of [power tools](## "utensili elettrici") as murder weapons, the killer as a large, silent, masked figure, [devoid](## "priva") of personality, and the sadistic killing of victims. The film’s roots can be seen in numerous classic movies, including Halloween, The Evil Dead, The Blair Witch Project and The Silence of the [Lambs](## "agnelli").
