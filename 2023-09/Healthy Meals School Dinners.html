<p>School dinners (that means ‘lunch’) are a <a href="##" title="tema scottante, attuale">hot topic</a> in the UK these days and there are lots of different opinions about what young people eat at lunchtime. Some people think that school <a href="##" title="pasti">meals</a> are unhealthy, some people say that they are much better than in the past and others say that <a href="##" title="mezzogiorno">midday</a> <a href="##" title="pasti">meals</a> should be free for all schoolchildren.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-school-dinner">WHAT IS A SCHOOL DINNER?</h2>

<p>More than a third of British school pupils have school dinner. Others take a <a href="##" title="pranzo al sacco, schiscetta">packed lunch</a> to school, prepared at home, or have lunch at home, or even eat at <a href="##" title="nelle vicinanze">nearby</a> take-away restaurants. A typical school dinner costs about two pounds a day for a secondary pupil in the UK. There is usually a <a href="##" title="piatto principale">main course</a>, a dessert and a drink. Parents <a href="##" title="spesso">often</a> pay in advance online. School dinners must include food groups such as fruit and vegetables, protein (for example, <a href="##" title="carne">meat</a>, fish or cheese) and carbohydrates (for example, <a href="##" title="riso">rice</a> or pasta). There are <a href="##" title="norme">rules</a> about how the food is prepared: for instance, there are limits on the quantity of fried food served.</p>

<h2 id="neverseconds">NEVERSECONDS</h2>

<p>Martha Payne, from Scotland, started a blog called ‘Never<a href="##" title="bis">seconds</a>’ about her school dinners when she was just nine years old. She posted photographs of her lunch every day and gave the food a <a href="##" title="voto">grade</a><a href="##" title="da zero  a dieci">out of ten</a>. The <a href="##" title="voto">grade</a> depended on the quality and quantity of the food and how healthy it was. She didn’t always give good <a href="##" title="voto">grade</a>s. Her <a href="##" title="lamentele">complaints</a> included too much fried food, small quantities and hair in the food (<a href="##" title="che schifo!">yuck!</a>). Many people read her blog and young people from all over the world posted pictures of their school <a href="##" title="pasti">meals</a> on ‘Never<a href="##" title="bis">seconds</a>’.</p>

<h2 id="celebrity-input">CELEBRITY INPUT</h2>

<p>Jamie Oliver, the celebrity British chef, is passionate about school dinners. He thinks that they need to be healthier and <a href="##" title="più saporito">tastier</a>. Jamie helped to promote Martha’s blog and ‘Never<a href="##" title="bis">seconds</a>’ became very popular on social media websites. Martha also <a href="##" title="raccogliere fondi">raised money</a> for <a href="##" title="beneficenza">charity</a> and used it to provide food for more than 600,000 poor children around the world.</p>
