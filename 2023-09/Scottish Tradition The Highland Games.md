Think about Scotland and many will [picture](## "immaginarsi") men in kilts. Never is this more the case than during the Highland Games. From May through September, clubs and clans compete in a series of sporting challenges across Scotland. Some games are more well-known than others, [ranging](## "spaziando") from the tug o’ war and hammer throw, to the [shot put](## "lancio del peso") and the most famous of all: [tossing](## "lanciare, gettare") the [caber](## "tronco (scozzese)"), where [contestants](## "partecipanti") must throw a heavy [log](## "tronco") of Scottish pine [to land](## "atterrare") as [upright](## "dritto") as possible and [tip over](## "ribaltarsi") to the other side.

## MEDIEVAL ORIGINS
The games date back to medieval times. Clans competed as preparation for battle. Clan chiefs [were able](## "essere capaci")[to assess](## "valutare") participants to select bodyguards, fighters and messengers, as well as entertainers to keep them [amused](## "divertire") in their free time. They used everyday items that were easily found, such as stones and [log](## "tronco")s, and these are still used a millennium later!

## BLAIR CASTLE
Clans still exist today, preserving tradition but without any political power. They compete in the games proudly wearing their tartan colours. Over one hundred games are held during the season, starting with the Atholl [Gathering](## "raduno, riunione") at Blair Castle in Perthshire. The Atholl Highlanders are Europe’s last remaining private army, acting as personal bodyguard to the Duke of Atholl, chief of the Clan Murray. They begin the games with the March On, an impressive parade of [pipes](## "flauti") and drums.

##  

## BRAEMAR GATHERING
The most famous event is the Braemar [Gathering](## "raduno, riunione") in Aberdeenshire. [Patronised](## "patrocinare") by royalty since Queen Victoria’s first visit in 1848, last year’s event was [attended](## "presenziare") by the then-Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Princess Anne. The Braemar Highland Society’s [aims](## "mirare a") include the preservation of the kilt and the language and the culture of the Highlands. It does so successfully, as the gathering — which takes place on the first Saturday of September — attracts some ten thousand visitors every year.

## PROUD SCOTSMEN
While [contestants](## "partecipanti") must be members of the Royal Scottish Highland Games Association, which is the official [governing body](## "organismo direttivo"), anyone is welcome to go and watch. The games are an unforgettable experience, a true celebration of Highland culture and tradition, with [craft stalls](## "bancarelle di artigianato"), [bagpipe](## "cornamusa") music, local delicacies, whisky, dancing and, of course, big men in kilts throwing heavy objects!
