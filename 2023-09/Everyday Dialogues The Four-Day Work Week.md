Più tempo da dedicare a se stessi, alla famiglia e agli amici: non si tratta di un'utopia, ma della riduzione dell'orario di lavoro settimanale.

Oscar: Hello! We always meet by the [water cooler](## "distributore d’acqua")!
Diana: I know! **How are you keeping**? Are you enjoying the four-day week [trial](## "sperimentazione")?
Oscar: Yes, it’s great, isn’t it? I feel **kind of **[guilty](## "colpevole"), [though](## "comunque").
Diana: Why? **It’s not like** it’ll affect the company’s [profits](## "profitti").
Oscar: But how can that be true? We’re working less for the same money!
Diana: Because we’re more productive! We use our worktime better.
Oscar: Yes, I do try to use every minute to **get stuff done**.
Diana: Exactly. But it’s so great I have more time with my **kids**. And I don’t have [to waste](## "sprecare") Saturdays food shopping.
Oscar: I guess we’ll all be less stressed. **As they say**, a happy [workforce](## "personale") is a productive [workforce](## "personale").
Diana: That’s right. Fewer people **skiving off**, too, now we have more personal time.
Oscar: OK, you’ve convinced me. I’ve got to get back to work, [though](## "comunque"). Less time for **chatting** by the [water cooler](## "distributore d’acqua"), haha!

## NOW  LET’S  REVIEW  THE  VOCABULARY!
**Water coolers** are places where office staff often casually meet to talk and [gossip](## "spettegolare").
“**How are you keeping**?” is a variation of “How are you?”
‘**Kind of**’ is a casual expression, meaning ‘a little bit’ or ‘[to some extent](## "fino a un certo punto")’.
A [statement](## "affermazione") that starts with ‘**It’s not like**’ (or ‘It’s not as if’) indicates that it is not true.
‘**To get stuff done’** means to complete your [tasks](## "compiti") or responsibilities. ‘Stuff’ is colloquial for ‘things’; in this context, work-related things.
‘**Kids**’ is a colloquial word for ‘children’. Literally, a ‘kid’ is a [baby goat](## "capretto").
‘**As they say**’ is a phrase used to introduce a proverb or well-known saying.
When you don’t go to work or school when you should be there, you are ‘**skiving off**’.
‘**To chat**’ means ‘to talk in an informal way’. ‘Chat’ is also a [noun](## "sostantivo"), for example, ‘to have a nice chat’.
