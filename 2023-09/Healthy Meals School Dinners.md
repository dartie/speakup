School dinners (that means ‘lunch’) are a [hot topic](## "tema scottante, attuale") in the UK these days and there are lots of different opinions about what young people eat at lunchtime. Some people think that school [meals](## "pasti") are unhealthy, some people say that they are much better than in the past and others say that [midday](## "mezzogiorno") [meals](## "pasti") should be free for all schoolchildren.

## WHAT IS A SCHOOL DINNER?
More than a third of British school pupils have school dinner. Others take a [packed lunch](## "pranzo al sacco, schiscetta") to school, prepared at home, or have lunch at home, or even eat at [nearby](## "nelle vicinanze") take-away restaurants. A typical school dinner costs about two pounds a day for a secondary pupil in the UK. There is usually a [main course](## "piatto principale"), a dessert and a drink. Parents [often](## "spesso") pay in advance online. School dinners must include food groups such as fruit and vegetables, protein (for example, [meat](## "carne"), fish or cheese) and carbohydrates (for example, [rice](## "riso") or pasta). There are [rules](## "norme") about how the food is prepared: for instance, there are limits on the quantity of fried food served.

##  

## NEVERSECONDS
Martha Payne, from Scotland, started a blog called ‘Never[seconds](## "bis")’ about her school dinners when she was just nine years old. She posted photographs of her lunch every day and gave the food a [grade](## "voto")[out of ten](## "da zero  a dieci"). The [grade](## "voto") depended on the quality and quantity of the food and how healthy it was. She didn’t always give good [grade](## "voto")s. Her [complaints](## "lamentele") included too much fried food, small quantities and hair in the food ([yuck!](## "che schifo!")). Many people read her blog and young people from all over the world posted pictures of their school [meals](## "pasti") on ‘Never[seconds](## "bis")’.

## CELEBRITY INPUT
Jamie Oliver, the celebrity British chef, is passionate about school dinners. He thinks that they need to be healthier and [tastier](## "più saporito"). Jamie helped to promote Martha’s blog and ‘Never[seconds](## "bis")’ became very popular on social media websites. Martha also [raised money](## "raccogliere fondi") for [charity](## "beneficenza") and used it to provide food for more than 600,000 poor children around the world.
