<p>Located in historic Greenwich, the London borough that gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time, Greenwich Peninsula is a <a href="##" title="florido, prospero">thriving</a> urban area <a href="##" title="incastonata in">nestled in</a> a <a href="##" title="ansa">bend</a> of the River Thames. A place where coolness meets relaxation, Greenwich Peninsula was <a href="##" title="individuare">singled out</a> as an opportunity area in the 2004 London Plan: a strategic framework for city development <a href="##" title="concepire">devised</a> by the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. Since then, over 5,500 new homes have been built, with approximately 32 per cent of them considered <a href="##" title="accessibile, conveniente">affordable</a>. Under the direction of the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, the ambitious industrial regeneration <a href="##" title="piano">scheme</a> is ongoing: seventeen thousand homes new homes are planned, with fifteen thousand new jobs created by 2041.</p>

<h2 id="architecture-and-nature">ARCHITECTURE AND NATURE</h2>

<p>Greenwich Peninsula is a must-visit for architecture enthusiasts. International architects have left their distinctive mark on the area, with <a href="##" title="audace">bold</a> and eclectic buildings. Moreover, Greenwich Peninsula <a href="##" title="vantarsi">boasts</a> London’s first elevated riverside linear park, called the <a href="##" title="marea">Tide</a>, adorned with installations and sculptures. The area is not solely about <a href="##" title="all’avanguardia">state-of-the-art</a> structures, however: with its bike <a href="##" title="corsie">lanes</a> and green areas, there is also ample space to relax, or take a <a href="##" title="passeggiata">stroll</a> along the river.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-river">ON THE RIVER</h2>

<p>Walking by the River Thames is a relaxing activity enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. On Greenwich Peninsula, however, this experience is all the more enjoyable: in addition to the traditional boats that <a href="##" title="navigare">sail</a> to the city centre, high-speed catamarans travel from North Greenwich to Embankment, offering stunning views of the Tower of London or of London’s business district, the City. On a sunny day, especially, it is a comfortable way to explore London and it is also a common mode of transport for <a href="##" title="pendolari">commuters</a> on weekdays.</p>

<h2 id="up-in-the-air">UP IN THE AIR</h2>

<p>The London <a href="##" title="funivia">cable car</a>, also known as the <a href="##" title="penzolare">Dangleway</a>, offers another unique experience. The <a href="##" title="funivia">cable car</a> crosses the Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks, and offers aerial views of <a href="##" title="punti di riferimento, attrazioni">landmarks</a> such as St Paul’s Cathedral and the <a href="##" title="cetriolino">Gherkin</a>. Designed by British architect Norman Foster, the <a href="##" title="cetriolino">Gherkin</a> is <a href="##" title="probabilmente">arguably</a> the capital’s most famous <a href="##" title="grattacieli">skyscraper</a>. In this south-east neighbourhood, the dome-shaped O2 complex by architect Richard Rogers includes a <a href="##" title="locale">venue</a> that hosts concerts and performances by famous artists from all over the world. There is also a large shopping area with bars and restaurants and a multi-screen cinema, as well as many other <a href="##" title="svago, tempo libero">leisure</a> activities. Visitors can now experience an incredible 360-degree view of London from its roof.</p>

<h2 id="design-district">DESIGN DISTRICT</h2>

<p>At the heart of Greenwich Peninsula, a permanent creative hub called the Design District has recently been established. This workspace, housing sixteen unique buildings, aims to attract creative companies and <a href="##" title="artigiani">craft artists</a>, from lighting designers to photographers, tattoo artists to ceramists, with an interesting programme of talks, <a href="##" title="innovativo, all’avanguardia">cutting-edge</a> exhibitions, open-studio events and workshops.  </p>
