# Dr. App: What’s Good for You?   [A2]

Di recente sono diventate popolari le app che valutano la qualità e la sicurezza di alimenti e cosmetici. Tuttavia, gli esperti avvertono che la loro affidabilità potrebbe non essere così elevata come spesso si sostiene.

The producers of food and cosmetics often [claim](## "affermare") that their products are beneficial for your health or appearance. But how do you really know? Don’t worry, there’s an app for that! In fact, there are now many apps that [rate](## "valutare") the safety of such products, and they have exploded in popularity in recent years.

## MOST POPULAR
Yuka is the world’s favourite food and cosmetic scanning app. You can download it for free and install it on your phone. You can then use it to scan practically any relevant product, and it will give you a [rating](## "valutazione") [out of 100](## "da zero a cento"). Theoretically, the higher the score, the [safer](## "più sicuro") the product. 

## MADE IN FRANCE
Yuka launched in France in 2017 and was an immediate success. Five years later, thanks to a TikTok video that went viral, it [landed](## "arrivare") in the US, where it [proved](## "dimostrare") a huge [hit](## "successo") with millennials and Gen Zers. Today, it is [among](## "tra") the leading apps in the health and fitness category on Apple Store and Google Play, and it has over fifty-six million users in twelve countries. 

## HOW IT WORKS
A [rating](## "valutazione") is determined by an algorithm that searches the internet for relevant medical studies and other legitimate [sources](## "fonti"). Food products get points for having high levels of essential nutrients, like protein and calcium, but lose points for having high levels of sugar or sodium, or potentially [harmful](## "dannosi") additives.

## COPYCATS
Yuka’s success led to the launch of similar apps, including Think Dirty and Open Food Facts, which also have millions of users. The apps are normally free but offer [in-app purchases](## "acquisti nella app") or products (IAP). They [pride themselves](## "vantarsi") on being independent, [refusing](## "rifiuatre") sponsorship by [brands](## "marchi"). Because of their popularity, their [rating](## "valutazione") of a product can influence its sales, [for better or worse](## "in meglio o in peggio").

## OVERSIMPLIFIED
Industry experts [warn](## "avvertire") that the information on these apps can oversimplify a product’s content. For example, apps will only inform of the presence of a [chemical](## "prodotti chimici"), and not the quantity [it comes in](## "essere presente"), when a minor amount can be [harmless](## "innocua"). The resultant [rating](## "valutazione") can [mislead](## "ingannare") users. The experts’ [advice](## "consiglio") is not to depend on any one app for information: investigate multiple [sources](## "fonti") and user [reviews](## "recensioni") so that you can make an informed decision.
