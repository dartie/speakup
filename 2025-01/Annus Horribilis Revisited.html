<p>The <a href="##" title="defunta">late</a> Queen Elizabeth II declared 1992 an “annus horribilis.” That year saw the separation of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the divorce of Princess Anne from Captain Mark Phillips, the publication of Diana: Her True Story, the fire at Windsor Castle and <a href="##" title="implacabile">relentless</a> gossip in the tabloid press.
Many unfortunate events have <a href="##" title="assilare">beleaguered</a> the Royal Family in 2024. King Charles III was also diagnosed with cancer in February 2024, following surgery on an <a href="##" title="rigonfiata">enlarged</a> prostate. He resumed his public <a href="##" title="doveri">duties</a> at the end of April 2024. His first public visit was to a cancer treatment centre with Queen Camilla. He also made a surprise visit to an army n Hampshire, where he joked about being <a href="##" title="permettere di uscire">allowed out</a> of his <a href="##" title="gabbia">cage</a>. His treatment continues, although it was paused for a Commonwealth state visit to Australia and Samoa. 
Commonwealth is one of the four Cs that define his work, along with climate, community and culture. To this, he has added a new C: cancer. King Charles has used his illness <a href="##" title="sottolineare">to highlight</a> the need for early diagnosis and treatment. As the monarchy struggles to stay relevant in a changing society — there is a big generational <a href="##" title="divisione">divide</a> — the events of the past months have <a href="##" title="provocare">prompted</a> much sympathy from the public.
In addition to the illnesses of the King and the Princess of Wales, there is the <a href="##" title="tesa">strained</a> relationship with Prince Harry and his wife Meghan and, as ever, the gossip in the tabloid press. However, the <a href="##" title="marea">tide</a> seems to be <a href="##" title="cambiare">turning</a> for the Royal Family. Both the King and his <a href="##" title="nuora">daughter-in-law</a> appear to be recovering. Prince Andrew’s daughter Beatrice is expecting her second child. Royals are taking to sharing <a href="##" title="che scalda il cuore">heartwarming</a> messages on social media. Even Harry is back to non-controversial charity work. It’s a new era in which royals are trying to communicate on a more <a href="##" title="comprensibile">relatable</a> level, showing kindness and compassion. For now at least, things are looking brighter.  </p>
