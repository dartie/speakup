Catherine, Princess of Wales, is back! Perhaps the Royal Family’s most popular member, her official return to work mid-September marked the end of a year of illness, [shrouded](## "ricoprire") in rumour and speculation. Her [handling](## "gestione") of the situation is a complete [departure](## "cambiamento") from traditional royal communications. Instead of official statements through the usual Kensington Palace channels, she has been publishing personal videos, speaking to the public on a human and very un-royal level.

## KEEPING THE FAITH
Catherine was [admitted to hospital](## "ricoverare in ospedale") for abdominal surgery in January last year, causing the [rumour mill](## "fonte di chiacchiere") [to churn](## "produrre in massa"). In March, in a video statement, she announced she was [undergoing](## "sottoporsi") preventative chemotherapy. She explained her [delay](## "ritardo") in [speaking out](## "parlare"): “William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately [for the sake of](## "per il bene di") our young family. … It has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that’s appropriate for them and to reassure them that I’m going to be okay.” She made no mention of King Charles, who was also being treated for cancer. At the end of her statement, she asked that [fellow](## "compagni") sufferers “do not lose faith or hope.”

## MOTHER’S DAY MISSTEP
Catherine [largely](## "per lo più") [withdrew](## "ritirarsi") from public during her treatment. For a [while](## "nel frattempo"), it seemed that people respected her call to #BeKind, but soon enough, conspiracy theories were [rife](## "abbondanti") on social media. A family photo, [released](## "publicar") by Kensington Palace on 10 May for Mother’s Day, was revealed to have been manipulated. The first official image since her operation, it was quickly withdrawn by the major photo agencies, followed by ‘[kill notices](## "avviso di rimozione")’ to [news outlets](## "mezzi di comunicazione") to stop using it. Catherine posted on X that it was simply a case of her experimenting with photo editing and apologised for the confusion. In the following months, she made two public appearances, at the King’s birthday parade (Trooping the Colour) and at the Wimbledon tennis championship, [to hand](## "consegnare") the trophy to Carlos Alcaraz.

## A MESSAGE FROM CATHERINE
All the [while](## "nel frattempo"), her condition and treatment were kept secret and the nature of her cancer remains unknown. What she has been [willing](## "disposta") to reveal, she shared on her own terms. In a format never before seen from the Royal Family, an intimate, advertising-quality video was published on social media announcing the end of her chemotherapy. In it, we see Catherine and her family [strolling](## "passeggiare") through wheat [fields](## "campi di grano"), playing, [hugging](## "abbracciare") and roasting [marshmallows](## "toffolette, cotone dolce"). At one point, a butterfly [flies off](## "volare via da") her hand. Despite the high production value, she [comes across as](## "sembrare, dare l’impressione di") authentic, never looking at the camera, her [voice-over](## "voce fuori campo") providing a [carefully-scripted](## "scritto con cura") narrative in which she says she is “taking each day as it comes.”

## “LIFE’S WORK”
A week after the video’s release, Catherine officially went back to work. A quiet meeting with the Centre for Early Childhood, at its Windsor Castle headquarters, was recorded in the royal events register. She launched the charity in 2021, focusing on the impact of the first five years on a person’s life, to improve societal health and happiness. She has referred to the centre’s projects as her “life’s work.” She also made a surprise visit to Southport in October, to meet with those affected by the horrific killings of three young girls in the summer. Her diary is being carefully managed, but her [handling](## "gestione") of her situation has given her a measure of privacy, respect and all-round compassion.
