Located in historic Greenwich, the London borough that gave its name to Greenwich Mean Time, Greenwich Peninsula is a [thriving](## "florido, prospero") urban area [nestled in](## "incastonata in") a [bend](## "ansa") of the River Thames. A place where coolness meets relaxation, Greenwich Peninsula was [singled out](## "individuare") as an opportunity area in the 2004 London Plan: a strategic framework for city development [devised](## "concepire") by the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. Since then, over 5,500 new homes have been built, with approximately 32 per cent of them considered [affordable](## "accessibile, conveniente"). Under the direction of the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, the ambitious industrial regeneration [scheme](## "piano") is ongoing: seventeen thousand homes new homes are planned, with fifteen thousand new jobs created by 2041.

## ARCHITECTURE AND NATURE
Greenwich Peninsula is a must-visit for architecture enthusiasts. International architects have left their distinctive mark on the area, with [bold](## "audace") and eclectic buildings. Moreover, Greenwich Peninsula [boasts](## "vantarsi") London’s first elevated riverside linear park, called the [Tide](## "marea"), adorned with installations and sculptures. The area is not solely about [state-of-the-art](## "all’avanguardia") structures, however: with its bike [lanes](## "corsie") and green areas, there is also ample space to relax, or take a [stroll](## "passeggiata") along the river.

## ON THE RIVER
Walking by the River Thames is a relaxing activity enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. On Greenwich Peninsula, however, this experience is all the more enjoyable: in addition to the traditional boats that [sail](## "navigare") to the city centre, high-speed catamarans travel from North Greenwich to Embankment, offering stunning views of the Tower of London or of London’s business district, the City. On a sunny day, especially, it is a comfortable way to explore London and it is also a common mode of transport for [commuters](## "pendolari") on weekdays.

## UP IN THE AIR
The London [cable car](## "funivia"), also known as the [Dangleway](## "penzolare"), offers another unique experience. The [cable car](## "funivia") crosses the Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks, and offers aerial views of [landmarks](## "punti di riferimento, attrazioni") such as St Paul’s Cathedral and the [Gherkin](## "cetriolino"). Designed by British architect Norman Foster, the [Gherkin](## "cetriolino") is [arguably](## "probabilmente") the capital’s most famous [skyscraper](## "grattacieli"). In this south-east neighbourhood, the dome-shaped O2 complex by architect Richard Rogers includes a [venue](## "locale") that hosts concerts and performances by famous artists from all over the world. There is also a large shopping area with bars and restaurants and a multi-screen cinema, as well as many other [leisure](## "svago, tempo libero") activities. Visitors can now experience an incredible 360-degree view of London from its roof.

## DESIGN DISTRICT
At the heart of Greenwich Peninsula, a permanent creative hub called the Design District has recently been established. This workspace, housing sixteen unique buildings, aims to attract creative companies and [craft artists](## "artigiani"), from lighting designers to photographers, tattoo artists to ceramists, with an interesting programme of talks, [cutting-edge](## "innovativo, all’avanguardia") exhibitions, open-studio events and workshops.
