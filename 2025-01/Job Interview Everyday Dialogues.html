Bob:The job is exactly the kind of work I love  doing and I’ve always wanted to work for this company.

<h2 id="now-let-s-review-the-vocabulary">NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!</h2>

<p>Administration is often <a href="##" title="ridurre">shortened</a> to ‘admin’.
Post and ‘position’ are both words to describe a job.
CV is <a href="##" title="diminutivo">short for</a> ‘curriculum vitae’ (‘resumé’ in the US.)
To fit the bill means to be <a href="##" title="adatto, idoneo, adeguato">suitable</a> for a specific <a href="##" title="scopo">purpose</a>.
Job can refer to a paid position of employment (as it is used here) or an individual task or project.
Staff refers to all the people employed by a company. Synonyms include ‘personnel’ or ‘workforce’.
Personal development <a href="##" title="mettere in relazione">relates to</a> <a href="##" title="automiglioramento">self-improvement</a>. Here, it <a href="##" title="mettere in relazione">relates to</a> career goals, for example, confidence, conflict resolution, time management, active listening or teamwork.
Sustainability is a <a href="##" title="tema ampio">broad topic</a>, usually referring to environmental and social impact.
In the context of sustainability, responsible is often used as an adjective to describe companies, processes and <a href="##" title="comportamenti">behaviours</a> that are ethical and environmentally-friendly.
A ‘customer-facing’ worker is literally that: an employee who <a href="##" title="trattare">deals</a> directly with <a href="##" title="clienti">customers</a>. Typical customer-facing jobs are shop assistants, <a href="##" title="venditori">salespeople</a> or <a href="##" title="servizio assistenza clienti">helpdesk</a> workers.
In this context, to accommodate means to fit in with a person’s <a href="##" title="desideri">wishes</a>. 
To get back to someone means you will contact them soon with an answer.
