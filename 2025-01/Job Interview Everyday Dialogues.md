Karla: Thanks for coming in today, Kevin.  So, you’re interested in the admin  assistant post
Bob:Yes, that’s right. Thank you for  inviting me.
Karla: Well, your CV looked interesting. Your experience [certainly](## "certamente") fits the bill.
Bob:That’s good to hear!
Karla: We’d like to know a bit about why you are applying for this position.
Bob:The job is exactly the kind of work I love  doing and I’ve always wanted to work for this company.
Karla: Really? Why is that?
Bob:  I’ve read great things about how you treat your staff, the opportunities for personal development and [most of all](## "più di tutto, soprattutto") , your reputation for  sustainability.
Karla: Yes, we try hard to be a responsible company. Do you have any questions for us?
Bob:I’m thinking of doing a Master’s and would like to know if there is any flexibility in [working hours](## "orario di lavoro").
Karla: Sure. It’s not a customer-facing position and as long as you [get the job done](## "finire il lavoro"),  [within](## "all’interno di") reasonable hours,  we could [certainly](## "certamente")  accommodate you there.
Bob: That’s excellent news!
Karla: Great. Let me speak to my colleagues and we’ll get back to you [within](## "all’interno di") a few days. Thanks for your time.

## NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!
Administration is often [shortened](## "ridurre") to ‘admin’.
Post and ‘position’ are both words to describe a job.
CV is [short for](## "diminutivo") ‘curriculum vitae’ (‘resumé’ in the US.)
To fit the bill means to be [suitable](## "adatto, idoneo, adeguato") for a specific [purpose](## "scopo").
Job can refer to a paid position of employment (as it is used here) or an individual task or project.
Staff refers to all the people employed by a company. Synonyms include ‘personnel’ or ‘workforce’.
Personal development [relates to](## "mettere in relazione") [self-improvement](## "automiglioramento"). Here, it [relates to](## "mettere in relazione") career goals, for example, confidence, conflict resolution, time management, active listening or teamwork.
Sustainability is a [broad topic](## "tema ampio"), usually referring to environmental and social impact.
In the context of sustainability, responsible is often used as an adjective to describe companies, processes and [behaviours](## "comportamenti") that are ethical and environmentally-friendly.
A ‘customer-facing’ worker is literally that: an employee who [deals](## "trattare") directly with [customers](## "clienti"). Typical customer-facing jobs are shop assistants, [salespeople](## "venditori") or [helpdesk](## "servizio assistenza clienti") workers.
In this context, to accommodate means to fit in with a person’s [wishes](## "desideri"). 
To get back to someone means you will contact them soon with an answer.
