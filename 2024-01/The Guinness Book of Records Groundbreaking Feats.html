<p>The book of Guinness World Records has been <a href="##" title="suscitare">sparking</a> curiosity around the globe since 1955. That year, the first edition was <a href="##" title="pubblicare">released</a> in the summer, and by Christmas it had already become Britain’s number one bestseller.</p>

<h2 id="brewed-in-ireland">BREWED IN IRELAND</h2>

<p>The Managing Director of the <a href="##" title="rinomata">renowned</a> Guinness <a href="##" title="birrificio">Brewery</a> in Ireland kept finding himself in situations where, when he tried <a href="##" title="risolvere">to figure out</a> which one of two things was faster, for instance, he had nowhere to go to find out. He had no way to check which, who or what was beating a record. He imagined that people everywhere must be having the same <a href="##" title="problema">issue</a>, and concluded that a guide with definitive answers could supply this demand.</p>

<h2 id="a-love-of-facts">A LOVE OF FACTS</h2>

<p>Chris Chataway, a record-breaking athlete, who was also an employee at the Guinness Park Royal <a href="##" title="birrificio">Brewery</a> in London, recommended twins Norris and Ross McWhirter as the perfect candidates to compile a book on world records. What made them ideal for the job was their love of facts: they had been working as sports journalists since 1950, and ran an agency supplying facts and figures to Fleet Street newspapers. The McWhirters were <a href="##" title="incaricare">commissioned</a> to create The Guinness Book of Records.
This book has gone on to establish itself as a universally-recognised authority on record-breaking <a href="##" title="conquista, risultato">achievement</a>. Published in more than a hundred countries and in twenty-five languages, it is one of the highest-selling books ever, with over three million copies sold each year. </p>

<h2 id="defying-the-digital-times">DEFYING THE (DIGITAL) TIMES</h2>

<p>With the dominant role of social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram or X (<a href="##" title="precedentemente">formerly</a> known as Twitter), the current digital landscape <a href="##" title="porre una domanda">begs the question</a>: is there still a place for a physical book like that of the Guinness World Records? Perhaps there is, as its role <a href="##" title="risiedere">lies</a> precisely in differentiating itself from the more volatile relativism of social media by providing a fixed, solid <a href="##" title="resoconto">account</a> of verified facts. 
<a href="##" title="inoltre">Moreover</a>, the book offers a range of inspiring stories for a public that might want <a href="##" title="indirizzare">to steer away</a> from digital platforms. It can be a gift in which children can find inspiration to achieve any <a href="##" title="impresa">feat</a>, or a pastime for elderly people looking to record-breakers for inspiration and <a href="##" title="certezza">reassurance</a> that it’s never too late.  </p>
