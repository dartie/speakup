The book of Guinness World Records has been [sparking](## "suscitare") curiosity around the globe since 1955. That year, the first edition was [released](## "pubblicare") in the summer, and by Christmas it had already become Britain’s number one bestseller.

## BREWED IN IRELAND
The Managing Director of the [renowned](## "rinomata") Guinness [Brewery](## "birrificio") in Ireland kept finding himself in situations where, when he tried [to figure out](## "risolvere") which one of two things was faster, for instance, he had nowhere to go to find out. He had no way to check which, who or what was beating a record. He imagined that people everywhere must be having the same [issue](## "problema"), and concluded that a guide with definitive answers could supply this demand.

## A LOVE OF FACTS
Chris Chataway, a record-breaking athlete, who was also an employee at the Guinness Park Royal [Brewery](## "birrificio") in London, recommended twins Norris and Ross McWhirter as the perfect candidates to compile a book on world records. What made them ideal for the job was their love of facts: they had been working as sports journalists since 1950, and ran an agency supplying facts and figures to Fleet Street newspapers. The McWhirters were [commissioned](## "incaricare") to create The Guinness Book of Records.
This book has gone on to establish itself as a universally-recognised authority on record-breaking [achievement](## "conquista, risultato"). Published in more than a hundred countries and in twenty-five languages, it is one of the highest-selling books ever, with over three million copies sold each year. 

## DEFYING THE (DIGITAL) TIMES
With the dominant role of social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram or X ([formerly](## "precedentemente") known as Twitter), the current digital landscape [begs the question](## "porre una domanda"): is there still a place for a physical book like that of the Guinness World Records? Perhaps there is, as its role [lies](## "risiedere") precisely in differentiating itself from the more volatile relativism of social media by providing a fixed, solid [account](## "resoconto") of verified facts. 
[Moreover](## "inoltre"), the book offers a range of inspiring stories for a public that might want [to steer away](## "indirizzare") from digital platforms. It can be a gift in which children can find inspiration to achieve any [feat](## "impresa"), or a pastime for elderly people looking to record-breakers for inspiration and [reassurance](## "certezza") that it’s never too late.
