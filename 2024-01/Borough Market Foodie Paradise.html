<p>Borough Market in South London is a foodie paradise. Over a hundred traders sell high-quality <a href="##" title="prodotti">produce</a> and serve up dishes from all over the world. They range from typical British <a href="##" title="cibo">fare</a> and gourmet foods such as oysters, to Mexican tacos, Spanish tapas, Chinese baos and Italian gelato. Famous for their excellent street food, some traders have appeared on MasterChef, while others have won BBC Food and Farming Awards. The market’s small artisan <a href="##" title="prodotti">produce</a>rs are known for their sustainable practices and their products often cannot be found anywhere else. </p>

<h2 id="one-thousand-years">ONE THOUSAND YEARS</h2>

<p>Borough Market’s history dates back a millennium. When London Bridge was built in the year 990, traders sold their <a href="##" title="merci">wares</a> on the route into the City. Southwark, on the south side of the River Thames, was considered an undesirable place, where crime flourished. In around 1270, traders were <a href="##" title="vietare">banned</a> from <a href="##" title="allesite">setting up</a> <a href="##" title="bancarelle">stalls</a> on the bridge, but the market continued to prosper. Southwark was incorporated into London and, by 1756, it was <a href="##" title="sovraffollato">overcrowded</a> with traders, merchants, taverns and <a href="##" title="bordelli">brothels</a>. Parliament threatened to close it down, so the market relocated to a new <a href="##" title="luogo">spot</a> <a href="##" title="vicino alla strada">off the High Street</a>, where it remains today. </p>

<h2 id="high-quality">HIGH QUALITY</h2>

<p>A railway viaduct was built through the middle of the market a century later, but the market, rather than having its business disrupted, became a centre for <a href="##" title="commercio all’ingrosso">wholesale</a> <a href="##" title="prodotti">produce</a>. Until the late 1990s, it was mainly a fruit and vegetable market. Then supermarkets became a threat to its existence. Borough Market transformed itself once again, this time as a <a href="##" title="mercato al dettaglio">retail market</a> for high-quality food. </p>

<h2 id="one-thousand-years-more">ONE THOUSAND YEARS MORE</h2>

<p>Borough Market today is a charity, existing for the benefit of the community. Thanks to a historic <a href="##" title="accordo">arrangement</a>, its income is still used to reduce the tax rates of the residents of St. Saviours in Southwark. <a href="##" title="nascosto">Nestled</a> between the railway arches at the foot of a cathedral, its unique location and gourmet food attract millions of visitors a year. However, the market is not just a tourist attraction. Locals <a href="##" title="[fare](## &quot;cibo">drop in</a> un salto&rdquo;) for their <a href="##" title="spesa settimanale">weekly grocery shopping</a> and workers come for lunch. Schoolchildren visit to learn about fresh <a href="##" title="prodotti">produce</a> and chefs come to discover new products. With a long history of reinventing itself, Borough Market is likely to be around for another thousand years.  </p>
