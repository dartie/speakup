**Gloria**: I love doing my **grocery shopping** at the market.
**Malcom**: Me, too! And Borough Market is my favourite.
**Gloria**: So what’s on your list? I need meat, fish and vegetables.
**Malcolm**: Fruit and **veg** for me. And perhaps a **ready meal or two**.
**Gloria**: OK, let’s start at the **fishmonger’s**. I’m a **regular**here.
**Malcom**: Oh, those [plaice](## "platesse") are a **bargain**! I’ll get a couple, too
**Gloria**: Right, what’s next? Ah, there’s a good fruit & veg [stall](## "banco"). Let’s see, I need **3lbs** of potatoes and some carrots, broccoli and onions
**Malcom**: I’ll get some tomatoes and [lettuce](## "lattuga") for tonight’s salad. And some of those lovely strawberries.
**Gloria**: Excellent! I just need [to pick up](## "prendere") a couple of [steaks](## "bistecche") at the**butcher’s**and then **I’m done**.
**Malcolm**: Right. Let’s go to Borough Market Kitchen for some **street food.** You can get some to **take away**, too.
**Gloria**: Good idea. I’ll show you the best place in town for tacos!
**Malcolm**: Great, **lead the way**!
 

## NOW  LET’S  REVIEW  THE  VOCABULARY!
**Grocery shopping** refers to shopping for food.
Veg is [short for](## "abbreviazione") ‘vegetables’.
A **ready meal** is a pre-cooked meal that only needs to be [heated](## "riscaldare").
A**fishmonger** is someone who sells fish. The apostrophe refers to the [retail outlet](## "punto vendita"), which is not usually mentioned: “I’m going to the fishmonger’s (store or [stall](## "banco"))”. Similar examples are ‘the butcher’s’, ‘the [baker’s](## "fornaio")’, ‘the [greengrocer’s](## "fruttivendolo")’, ‘the [chemist’s](## "farmacia")’, ‘the [newsagent’s](## "edicola")’, etc.
Used in this way, a**regular** is a frequent [customer](## "cliente").
A **bargain**is an item at a lower price than usual.
**3lbs** is equivalent to 1.37kg. ‘lbs’ is the abbreviation of ‘pounds’.
A**butcher** is someone who cuts and sells meat.
**I’m done** means “I am finished”.
Food and drink sold by vendors in a public place is called **street food**. 
At some places, you can choose to ‘eat in’ or**take away**the food (‘take out’in the US). ‘Take-away’ is also used as an adjective, e.g. ‘a take-away meal’.
**Lead the way** is a common phrase used to invite someone to go first, to show others where to go.
