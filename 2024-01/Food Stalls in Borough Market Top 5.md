Borough Market offers [a host](## "moltitudine") of places to eat and drink. Besides indoor restaurants, bars, cafés and pubs, there are stalls selling street food, many around the Borough Market Kitchen, which is an outdoor, covered [food court](## "area ristorazione"). Here is a selection of the best.
**1 Richard Haward Oysters**
For eight generations, the Haward family has been cultivating oysters in the River Blackwater, purifying them with sea water, which gives them a unique flavour. They can be enjoyed with a glass of [chilled](## "freddo") wine on its permanent stall on Stoney Street.
**2 The [Ginger](## "dai capelli rossi") Pig**
The [Ginger](## "dai capelli rossi") Pig [butcher’s](## "macellerie") specialise in the art of sausage making. The meat is [sourced](## "provenire") from small farmers who practise good animal [husbandry](## "allevamento") and all sausages and burgers are made by hand. Its [sausage rolls](## "involtini di salsicce") now have their own [cult following](## "cerchia di seguaci")!
**3 Horn OK Please**
“Horn OK Please” is a slogan often seen on cars and [rickshaws](## "risciò") in India and was the inspiration for the street food stall by couple Gaurav and Sandhya. It serves delicious vegetarian dishes such as moong dal dosa, dosa chaat and egg kati rolls.
**4 Furness Food Hut**
People [queue](## "fare la fila") every day for this stall’s famous bomba paella, where a [packed](## "pieno") plate costs £10. It also sells seasonal fish and [shellfish](## "crostacei") in the neighbouring stall, Furness Fish & Game, all [stocked](## "fornire") by its owner, Furness Food in Cumbria.
**5 [Humble](## "umile") Crumble**
Those with [a sweet tooth](## "essere golosi") can head for the “world’s first [crumble](## "tipo di torta inglese") bar”. [Humble](## "umile") Crumble sells homemade fruit [crumble](## "tipo di torta inglese")s, using ethically [sourced](## "provenire") ingredients. Its stall in Borough Kitchen Market also offers [crumble](## "tipo di torta inglese") [bundles](## "confezioni") ready to bake at home.
