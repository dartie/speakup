<p>Sarah: Hello, do you need some help?
Mario: Yes, please. I can’t make up my mind between these two coats.
Sarah: They’re both lovely. Is it for general use or are you going somewhere in particular?
Mario: No, it’s just for here. I’m not going <a href="##" title="escursionismo">hiking</a> in the snow or anything like that.
Sarah: Right, then, the blue one is good for both, as it has a windproof lining.
Mario: That’s good. But is it rainproof, too?
Sarah: Yes, the coat is completely waterproof. It’ll keep you dry in the heaviest downpour. 
Mario: I like the look, too, though the other one is more stylish
Sarah: Well, puffer jackets are all the rage right now, but the brown coat has a more classic look.
Mario: Yes, that one’s timeless.  I like that it’s not <a href="##" title="legare">tied</a> to any <a href="##" title="tendenza">trend</a>; it’ll be good for years. But is it <a href="##" title="antivento e impermeabile">wind-and waterproof</a> , too
Sarah: Ah, no. It’s fine for the city, but no good for <a href="##" title="escursionismo">hiking</a> in freezing conditions. It’ll keep you dry in a light shower, though.
Mario: Hmm. I’ll go for the brown one. I need a good everyday coat
Sarah: Excellent! Come this way and I’ll ring it up at the till for you.</p>

<h2 id="now-let-s-review-the-vocabulary">NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!</h2>

<p>To make up one’s mind means ‘to make a decision’.
The coat is for general use, <a href="##" title="cioè, ovvero, ossia (id est)">i.e.</a>, to be used every day, for any occasion.
Or anything like that is an informal idiom that shows that what you have said is just an example.
A windproof coat will not allow wind to enter the <a href="##" title="indumento, capo">garment</a>.
The lining of a coat is an interior <a href="##" title="strato">layer</a> of a different material.
A rainproof coat will not allow rain (or water) to enter the <a href="##" title="indumento, capo">garment</a>.
A waterproof coat will not allow water to enter the <a href="##" title="indumento, capo">garment</a>. The suffix ‘-proof’ means ‘protecting against’.
A downpour is a heavy fall of rain.
A puffer jacket (or simply a ‘puffer’) is a warm coat with insulated sections, which look like they are <a href="##" title="gonfio">puffed up</a>.
When something is <a href="##" title="tendenza">trend</a>y or popular, it is (all) the rage.
Timeless is the opposite of ‘<a href="##" title="tendenza">trend</a>y’, being classic or <a href="##" title="duraturo">long-lasting</a> in terms of fashion.
A light shower is a <a href="##" title="leggera">gentle</a>, brief <a href="##" title="precipitazione">rainfall</a>.
