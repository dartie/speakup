Sarah: Hello, do you need some help?
Mario: Yes, please. I can’t make up my mind between these two coats.
Sarah: They’re both lovely. Is it for general use or are you going somewhere in particular?
Mario: No, it’s just for here. I’m not going [hiking](## "escursionismo") in the snow or anything like that.
Sarah: Right, then, the blue one is good for both, as it has a windproof lining.
Mario: That’s good. But is it rainproof, too?
Sarah: Yes, the coat is completely waterproof. It’ll keep you dry in the heaviest downpour. 
Mario: I like the look, too, though the other one is more stylish
Sarah: Well, puffer jackets are all the rage right now, but the brown coat has a more classic look.
Mario: Yes, that one’s timeless.  I like that it’s not [tied](## "legare") to any [trend](## "tendenza"); it’ll be good for years. But is it [wind-and waterproof](## "antivento e impermeabile") , too
Sarah: Ah, no. It’s fine for the city, but no good for [hiking](## "escursionismo") in freezing conditions. It’ll keep you dry in a light shower, though.
Mario: Hmm. I’ll go for the brown one. I need a good everyday coat
Sarah: Excellent! Come this way and I’ll ring it up at the till for you.

## NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!
To make up one’s mind means ‘to make a decision’.
The coat is for general use, [i.e.](## "cioè, ovvero, ossia (id est)"), to be used every day, for any occasion.
Or anything like that is an informal idiom that shows that what you have said is just an example.
A windproof coat will not allow wind to enter the [garment](## "indumento, capo").
The lining of a coat is an interior [layer](## "strato") of a different material.
A rainproof coat will not allow rain (or water) to enter the [garment](## "indumento, capo").
A waterproof coat will not allow water to enter the [garment](## "indumento, capo"). The suffix ‘-proof’ means ‘protecting against’.
A downpour is a heavy fall of rain.
A puffer jacket (or simply a ‘puffer’) is a warm coat with insulated sections, which look like they are [puffed up](## "gonfio").
When something is [trend](## "tendenza")y or popular, it is (all) the rage.
Timeless is the opposite of ‘[trend](## "tendenza")y’, being classic or [long-lasting](## "duraturo") in terms of fashion.
A light shower is a [gentle](## "leggera"), brief [rainfall](## "precipitazione").
To go for means ‘to choose’.
Everyday literally means ‘used every day’.
To ring something up means to record an item a customer is paying for on the cash register.
