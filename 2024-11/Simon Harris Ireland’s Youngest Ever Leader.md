In Ireland, the Taoiseach is the head of government, and this year Simon Harris became the youngest ever Taoiseach, at the age of thirty-seven. Active in politics since he was a teenager, he has promised to prioritise rural interests, small businesses and education in his new role. 

## EARLY YEARS
Born in the coastal town of Greystones in County Wicklow, Harris is the [eldest child](## "figlio maggiore") of a taxi driver and a special needs assistant. At fifteen, he was inspired by his autistic brother Adam [to found](## "fondare") an autism support group. He also became a youth member of the liberal-conservative party Fine Gael, meaning ‘Family (or ‘Tribe’) of the Irish’. Fine Gael is now part of a coalition government with two other political parties: the conservative party Fianna Fáil (meaning ‘Soldiers of Destiny’), and the Green Party.

## A FAST LIFE
After finishing school, Harris began a [degree course](## "corso di laurea") in journalism and French at Dublin Institute of Technology. However, he left the course in his penultimate year to start a career in politics. At twenty-two, he became a [county councillor](## "consigliere") for Wicklow, and at twenty-four, he was elected to parliament, becoming the youngest [MP](## "deputato, parlamentare (Member of Parliament)") at the time.
Continuing this [trend](## "tendenza"), Harris became Ireland’s youngest-ever health minister in 2016, and led the country’s initial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. He later became the Minister for Justice, and then the Minister for [Further and Higher Education](## "istruzione complementare e superiore"). “In many ways, my career has been a bit [odd](## "strana")…,” he once told the Irish magazine Hot Press. “Life came at me a lot faster than I expected it to.”

## THE TIKTOK TAOISEACH
After the former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar resigned in March, Harris immediately became the new leader of the party and, on 9 April, he became the youngest Taoiseach ever. Known as the TikTok Taoiseach, he — like most millennials — is very active on social media. He has over two million likes on TikTok and hundreds of thousands of followers on X and Instagram, and posts almost every day.
