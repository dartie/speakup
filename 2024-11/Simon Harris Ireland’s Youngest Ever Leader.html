<p>In Ireland, the Taoiseach is the head of government, and this year Simon Harris became the youngest ever Taoiseach, at the age of thirty-seven. Active in politics since he was a teenager, he has promised to prioritise rural interests, small businesses and education in his new role. </p>

<h2 id="early-years">EARLY YEARS</h2>

<p>Born in the coastal town of Greystones in County Wicklow, Harris is the <a href="##" title="figlio maggiore">eldest child</a> of a taxi driver and a special needs assistant. At fifteen, he was inspired by his autistic brother Adam <a href="##" title="fondare">to found</a> an autism support group. He also became a youth member of the liberal-conservative party Fine Gael, meaning ‘Family (or ‘Tribe’) of the Irish’. Fine Gael is now part of a coalition government with two other political parties: the conservative party Fianna Fáil (meaning ‘Soldiers of Destiny’), and the Green Party.</p>

<h2 id="a-fast-life">A FAST LIFE</h2>

<p>After finishing school, Harris began a <a href="##" title="corso di laurea">degree course</a> in journalism and French at Dublin Institute of Technology. However, he left the course in his penultimate year to start a career in politics. At twenty-two, he became a <a href="##" title="consigliere">county councillor</a> for Wicklow, and at twenty-four, he was elected to parliament, becoming the youngest <a href="##" title="deputato, parlamentare (Member of Parliament)">MP</a> at the time.
Continuing this <a href="##" title="tendenza">trend</a>, Harris became Ireland’s youngest-ever health minister in 2016, and led the country’s initial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. He later became the Minister for Justice, and then the Minister for <a href="##" title="istruzione complementare e superiore">Further and Higher Education</a>. “In many ways, my career has been a bit <a href="##" title="strana">odd</a>…,” he once told the Irish magazine Hot Press. “Life came at me a lot faster than I expected it to.”</p>

<h2 id="the-tiktok-taoiseach">THE TIKTOK TAOISEACH</h2>

<p>After the former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar resigned in March, Harris immediately became the new leader of the party and, on 9 April, he became the youngest Taoiseach ever. Known as the TikTok Taoiseach, he — like most millennials — is very active on social media. He has over two million likes on TikTok and hundreds of thousands of followers on X and Instagram, and posts almost every day.  </p>
