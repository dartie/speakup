# Oliver Roeder: The Guessing Game   [B2]

È il gioco che meglio rappresenta il capitalismo: una grande posta in gioco, inganno e guerra psicologica; una maggioranza di perdenti e pochissimi vincitori. L’esperto di teoria dei giochi e di intelligenza artificiale Oliver Roeder ne analizza l’evoluzione.

[Chip in](## "mettere denaro, la posta"). [Lay your cards on the table](## "disporre le carte sul tavolo"). [Go all-in](## "puntare tutto"). The English language is [peppered](## "condito, disseminato") with poker terms. Such is the popularity of the game that even non-players know what is meant by these [idioms](## "modi di dire"). With the [rise](## "aumento") of online poker, it is no longer the exclusive domain of [high-flying players](## "giocatori d’alto livello"); anyone with an internet connection can instantly play for money. Unless you are a professional player, however, the [odds](## "probabilità") are you will lose more money than you win. So, what is it about poker that is so [appealing](## "attraente")?

## POKER FACE
For some, it is the psychology. For others, it is the [lure](## "richiamo") of money. According to the book Poker for [Dummies](## "stupidi"), “the objective of poker is to win money by capturing the pot, which contains bets made by various players during the hand.” Bets are made by players according to ‘their hand’ (that is, the cards they hold.) If they think they have a strong hand, they try to convince their opponents to ‘[fold](## "ritirarsi")’ or abandon their cards. They can also pretend to have a strong hand, even if they do not, as a [bluff](## "inganno"), intimi[dating](## "appuntamenti (romantici)") the other players into [fold](## "ritirarsi")ing. The best players can do this very convincingly, their face expressionless or exuding confidence. This is what is called a ‘poker face’.

## GAME THEORY
In the language of game theory, poker is a game of imperfect information. None of the players know which cards are held by the others. A big part of the strategy is [working out](## "calcolare") what cards they have in their hands. Such a skill is useful in real-life situations like negotiations, [dating](## "appuntamenti (romantici)") or even war, so poker attracts people from [all walks of life](## "di tutti i ceti sociali").
[Despite](## "nonostante") imperfect information, artificial intelligence has evolved [to such an extent](## "fino al punto") that it has optimised game play. In 2016, DeepStack became the first AI capable of beating professional poker players at ‘[heads-up](## "partita tra due giocatori"), no-limit Texas Hold’em’.

## TEXAS STYLE
Texas Hold’em is the most well-known variation of poker. There are three main categories: [draw games](## "poker coperto"), [stud games](## "poker scoperto") and community card games. Texas Hold’em belongs to [the latter](## "quest’ultima"). Heads-up games involve two players and no-limit poker means there is no limit to the size of the bets that can be placed. Today’s AIs are so good, they usually beat humans in any kind of poker. They are therefore used by players to train and improve their game. They know that, when the [chips](## "fiches") are down, poker apps can help them play the hand they’ve been [dealt](## "dare")!
