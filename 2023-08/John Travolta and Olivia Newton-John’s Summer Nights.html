<p>The story of a teenage summer romance in the 1950s, as told from the different points of view of Danny Zuko, a US high school student, and Sandy Olsson, an Australian who has moved to America, Summer Nights was a <a href="##" title="enorme">massive</a> hit in 1978. It will always be associated with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, who performed it for the film version of the musical <a href="##" title="brillantina">Grease</a>. However, the song, written by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, was first recorded by Barry Bostwick and Carole Demas for the 1972 Broadway production.
At the start of the new high school year, Danny, a macho <a href="##" title="donnaiolo">womaniser</a>, <a href="##" title="vantarsi">brags</a> about the physical aspects of his <a href="##" title="avventura, flirt">fling</a> to his gang, the T-Birds, exaggerating or even inventing some parts. Meanwhile, <a href="##" title="puritana">strait-laced</a> Sandy shares her far more innocent (and <a href="##" title="fedele">accurate</a>) version to the Pink Ladies, referring mainly to her emotions. The song is a stereotypical <a href="##" title="descrizione">depiction</a> of the <a href="##" title="presunto">alleged</a> difference between teenage boys and teenage girls. In today’s wider woke culture, some lyrics have provoked controversy, particularly the boys’ question “Did she <a href="##" title="opporre resistenza">put up a fight</a>?”
The lyrics are a succession of rhyming <a href="##" title="versi">couplet</a> and are almost all in the simple past tense, with their friends using the imperative to ask the <a href="##" title="narratori">storytellers</a> to “tell me more”. The song <a href="##" title="concludersi">winds down</a> with the revelation that the relationship has ended. <a href="##" title="quello che non sa">Little do Danny and Sandy know</a> that they are now at the same high school — fans of <a href="##" title="brillantina">Grease</a> know what happens next!
Summer loving, had me a blast
Summer loving, happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy cute as can be
Summer days, <a href="##" title="andare alla deriva">drifting away</a>
To-ah! Oh, the summer nights
 
Well-a, well-a, well-a, huh
Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?
Tell me more, tell me more
Like, does he have a car?
Uh huh (doo doo)
 
She swam by me, she got a <a href="##" title="crampo">cramp</a>
He ran by me, got my suit <a href="##" title="bagnato">damp</a>
I saved her life, she nearly <a href="##" title="annegare">drowned</a>
<a href="##" title="mettersi in mostra">He showed off</a>, splashing around
Summer sun, something’s begun
But ah! Oh, the summer nights
 
Well-a, well-a, well-a, huh
Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she <a href="##" title="opporre resistenza">put up a fight</a>?
Dow, doobie do, doobie do
 
Took her bowling in the <a href="##" title="sala giochi">arcade</a>
We went <a href="##" title="passeggiare">strolling</a>, drank lemonade
We made out under the <a href="##" title="molo">dock</a>
We stayed up ‘til ten o’clock
Summer <a href="##" title="avventura, flirt">fling</a>, don’t mean a thing
But ah! Oh, the summer nights
Whoa, whoa, whoa
 
Tell me more, tell me more
But you don’t gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
‘Cause he sounds like a drag
Shoo bop bop, shoo bop bop
 
He got friendly, holding my hand
Well, she got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet, just turned eighteen
Well, she was good, you know what I mean
Summer heat, boy and girl meet
But ah! Oh, the summer nights
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?
 
It turned colder, that’s where it ends
So I told her we’d still be friends
Then we made our true love <a href="##" title="voto">vow</a>
Wonder what she’s doing now
Summer dreams, ripped at the seams
But, oh
Those summer
Nights!
(Tell me more, tell me more, more, more)
