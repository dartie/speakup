# Funny and Weird: Animal Teamwork   [A2]

Senza dubbio la terminologia dei nomi collettivi degli animali non è indispensabile nello studio dell’inglese, tant’è che la maggior parte dei madrelingua non la conosce. In ogni caso è divertente scoprire la relazione fra i nomi e le caratteristiche proprie di ogni specie.

Animal group names, or collective [nouns](## "sostantivi") for animals, are specific words used to describe a collection of animals of the same [kind](## "tipo"). You are probably familiar with a number of them: for example, a group of wolves or dogs that hunt together is cal[led](## "condurre") a ‘[pack](## "branco, muta")’. The term ‘[swarm](## "sciame")’ is commonly used for a large group of insects, such as a [swarm](## "sciame") of bees or [locusts](## "locuste, cavallette"). A group of fish that stay together for social reasons is cal[led](## "condurre") a ‘[shoal](## "banco")’ and, if they are swimming in the same direction in a coordinated manner, is cal[led](## "condurre") a ‘[school](## "banco")’.
When we talk about a large group of animals, especially [mammals](## "mammiferi") with [hooves](## "zoccoli"), we refer to them as a ‘[herd](## "mandria")’ (a [herd](## "mandria") of cows or a [herd](## "mandria") of buffaloes, for example). In the case of birds, the collective term is ‘[flock](## "stormo")’, as in ‘a [flock](## "stormo") of [geese](## "oche")’. A group of big cats is a ‘pride’, while a group of domesticated cats is cal[led](## "condurre") a ‘clowder’ or a ‘glaring’. And a group of newborn puppies or kittens is referred to as a ‘[litter](## "cucciolata")’. When it comes to whales, dolphins or [porpoises](## "marsuini"), we call them a ‘pod’.

## THE BOOK OF ST. ALBANS
So, why are names in the animal kingdom often so [weird](## "strani") or funny? One reason is that many originated in medieval times, and were [linked](## "legare") to the English hunting tradition. Some are [traced](## "trovare, localizzare") to The Book of St. Albans, a 1486 [treatise](## "trattato") that includes a list with collective [nouns](## "sostantivi") for animals; similar lists were also compi[led](## "condurre") [throughout](## "nel corso") the 15th and 16th centuries. Many of these terms are still in use today, although they now seem bizarre. Some suggest [traits](## "tratti") of an animal (a ‘tower’ of giraffes or a ‘[leap](## "saltare")’ of leopards). They may evoke images, or sounds, or feelings and try to c[apt](## "adeguato")ure an animal’s personality. Some come from old English words that are [no longer](## "non più") in use.

## A Mess of Iguanas
An ‘[army](## "esercito")’ of [caterpillars](## "bruchi") or [ants](## "formiche") is probably derived from the [behaviour](## "comportamento") exhibited by these very well organised insects when they move in large groups. A ‘bask’ of crocodiles is likely referring to their habit of [basking](## "crogiolarsi") in the sun on [riverbanks](## "rive del fiume"). A ‘murder’ of crows is probably based on old superstitions of crows being [omens](## "presagio") of bad luck. A ‘[parade](## "sfilata")’ of eleph[ants](## "formiche") is a very evocative description of a group travelling huge distances [led](## "condurre") by the oldest female. A ‘[flamboyance](## "sfarzo")’ of flamingos is a perfect homage to these brightly-coloured birds. A ‘band’ of gorillas is a clear reference to a military term. A ‘bloat’ of hippopotamuses is an obvious allusion to their large, [bloated](## "gonfiarsi") [bel[lie](## "giacere")s](## "pance"), [whereas](## "mentre") a ‘[mess](## "pasticcio, confusione")’ of iguanas is a reference to their social habits, as they [lie](## "giacere") [intertwined](## "intrecciare, mischiare"). A ‘[cackle](## "risata, schiamazzo")’ of hyenas is an evident reference to the [raucous](## "rauco, sguaiato") sound of their [laughter](## "risata"), while a ‘[shadow](## "ombra")’ of jaguars c[apt](## "adeguato")ures their amazing camouflage [skills](## "abilità").

## A PRICKLE OF PORCUPINES
A group of [moles](## "talpe") is cal[led](## "condurre") a ‘labour’ because of the small [mammals](## "mammiferi")’ hard-working nature in [digging](## "scavare") tunnels. The playful nature of [mice](## "topi") has earned them the collective term of ‘[mischief](## "birichinata")’. [Otters](## "nutrie") floating in water in a large group are cal[led](## "condurre") a ‘[raft](## "zattera")’. A ‘parliament’ of [owls](## "civette") is maybe so named because of their legendary [wisdom](## "saggezza"). A ‘pandemonium’ of [parrots](## "pappagalli") is an irresistible description of their chaotic and noisy habits. A ‘[prickle](## "aculeo, formicolio")’ of [porcupines](## "porcospini") is an [apt](## "adeguato") reference to their [quills](## "aculei"). An ‘un[kind](## "tipo")ness’ of ravens reflects a moral judgment on their [uncaring](## "indifferente") [behaviour](## "comportamento") as parents or of their being [scavengers](## "saprofaghi") ([feeding](## "alimentarsi") on corpses of dead animals). A ‘crash’ of rhinoceroses likely originated from the sound made by a charging group. A ‘[shiver](## "brivido")’ of sharks is suggestive of the fear they cause or perhaps of the fact that most of them are cold-blooded. And what about an ‘[ambush](## "imboscata")’ of tigers? It is certainly a [befitting](## "adatto") name to describe the feeling of being [suddenly](## "improvvisamente") [surrounded](## "circondare") by these [fierce](## "feroci"), splendid beasts! Of course, there’s one group of ‘animals’ that we haven’t covered yet: human beings. Can you think of one or more names [suitable](## "idonei") for this group?
