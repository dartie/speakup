Muhammad Ali was born Cassius Clay in racially-segregated Louisville, Kentucky in 1942. He started boxing when he was twelve years old and proved to be a precocious talent, with a [dazzling](## "stupefacente") mix of power and speed. [Unlike](## "a differenza di") other boxers, who were [clunky](## "goffi, sgraziati") and [ponderous](## "pesanti"), he danced gracefully around the ring. Outside the ring he had great [charm](## "fascino"), persona[lit](## "accendere")y and humour. He was the first fighter to win the World [Heavyweight](## "pesi massimi") Championship three times, winning classic fights along the way against Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman. After beating Liston, he declared himself a follower of the Nation of Islam and took the name of Muhammad Ali. When he refused to fight in the Vietnam War in 1967, to the [anger](## "rabbia") of millions of White Americans, he was [banned](## "vietare") from boxing for more than three years. He then returned to the ring but some of his magic had disappeared. He finally retired in 1981.

## MOVING TRIBUTE
Ali was also one of the leaders of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and later became known for his philanthropic activities. A sufferer from Parkinson’s in his later years, he developed [slurred speech](## "biascicare") and slowed movement due to brain damage from repeated [blows](## "colpi") to his head. But he remained active and radical in public life. When a visibly-[weakened](## "debilitato") Ali [lit](## "accendere") the Olympic Flame at the start of the Games in Atlanta in 1996, his appearance, but also his pride and dignity, provoked a wonderfully warm reaction around the world. It remains one of the most [moving](## "emozionante") moments in sports history.

## THE GOAT
The GOAT: this [quirky](## "bizzarro") acronym is a term used to describe something or someone who is considered the absolute best ever in a certain category. Typically abbreviated as G.O.A.T. or GOAT, it appears [to undermine](## "minare") the very greatness implied given its more overt reference to the [farmyard](## "fattoria") animal, typically inciting [puns](## "giochi di parole") and securing its [catchiness](## "orecchiabilità"). In fact, G.O.A.T. has its origin in iconic boxer, Muhammad Ali. In 1992, Ali’s wife Lonnie incorporated G.O.A.T. Inc., an [umbrella company](## "società ombrello") to consolidate and license her husband’s intellectual properties for commercial purposes. In 1996, G.O.A.T. was first used online, and in 2000 LL Cool J really helped to popularise the word, when he [released](## "pubblicare") an album entitled G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time). The rapper credited Ali for its origin in a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, saying “Without Muhammad Ali the term G.O.A.T. would have never been [coined](## "coniare").” In fact, G.O.A.T was not to become officially a word until 2018, when it was deemed admissible to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. To do so, it had [to fulfil](## "adempiere") three criteria: that of being used by many people in many places; that of being used consistently and increasingly; and that of being used meaningfully, that is, in the same way by everyone.
