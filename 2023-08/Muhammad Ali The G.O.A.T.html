<p>Muhammad Ali was born Cassius Clay in racially-segregated Louisville, Kentucky in 1942. He started boxing when he was twelve years old and proved to be a precocious talent, with a <a href="##" title="stupefacente">dazzling</a> mix of power and speed. <a href="##" title="a differenza di">Unlike</a> other boxers, who were <a href="##" title="goffi, sgraziati">clunky</a> and <a href="##" title="pesanti">ponderous</a>, he danced gracefully around the ring. Outside the ring he had great <a href="##" title="fascino">charm</a>, persona<a href="##" title="accendere">lit</a>y and humour. He was the first fighter to win the World <a href="##" title="pesi massimi">Heavyweight</a> Championship three times, winning classic fights along the way against Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman. After beating Liston, he declared himself a follower of the Nation of Islam and took the name of Muhammad Ali. When he refused to fight in the Vietnam War in 1967, to the <a href="##" title="rabbia">anger</a> of millions of White Americans, he was <a href="##" title="vietare">banned</a> from boxing for more than three years. He then returned to the ring but some of his magic had disappeared. He finally retired in 1981.</p>

<h2 id="moving-tribute">MOVING TRIBUTE</h2>

<p>Ali was also one of the leaders of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and later became known for his philanthropic activities. A sufferer from Parkinson’s in his later years, he developed <a href="##" title="biascicare">slurred speech</a> and slowed movement due to brain damage from repeated <a href="##" title="colpi">blows</a> to his head. But he remained active and radical in public life. When a visibly-<a href="##" title="debilitato">weakened</a> Ali <a href="##" title="accendere">lit</a> the Olympic Flame at the start of the Games in Atlanta in 1996, his appearance, but also his pride and dignity, provoked a wonderfully warm reaction around the world. It remains one of the most <a href="##" title="emozionante">moving</a> moments in sports history.</p>

<h2 id="the-goat">THE GOAT</h2>

<p>The GOAT: this <a href="##" title="bizzarro">quirky</a> acronym is a term used to describe something or someone who is considered the absolute best ever in a certain category. Typically abbreviated as G.O.A.T. or GOAT, it appears <a href="##" title="minare">to undermine</a> the very greatness implied given its more overt reference to the <a href="##" title="fattoria">farmyard</a> animal, typically inciting <a href="##" title="giochi di parole">puns</a> and securing its <a href="##" title="orecchiabilità">catchiness</a>. In fact, G.O.A.T. has its origin in iconic boxer, Muhammad Ali. In 1992, Ali’s wife Lonnie incorporated G.O.A.T. Inc., an <a href="##" title="società ombrello">umbrella company</a> to consolidate and license her husband’s intellectual properties for commercial purposes. In 1996, G.O.A.T. was first used online, and in 2000 LL Cool J really helped to popularise the word, when he <a href="##" title="pubblicare">released</a> an album entitled G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time). The rapper credited Ali for its origin in a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, saying “Without Muhammad Ali the term G.O.A.T. would have never been <a href="##" title="coniare">coined</a>.” In fact, G.O.A.T was not to become officially a word until 2018, when it was deemed admissible to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. To do so, it had <a href="##" title="adempiere">to fulfil</a> three criteria: that of being used by many people in many places; that of being used consistently and increasingly; and that of being used meaningfully, that is, in the same way by everyone.
