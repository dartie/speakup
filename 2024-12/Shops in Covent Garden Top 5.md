London’s favourite place to shop is a mixture of international and British high-street brands, and small, independent [retailers](## "rivenditori"). Hungry shoppers can re-charge their batteries by eating at a wide variety of restaurants, ranging from Michelin-starred establishments to simple sandwich shops and delicatessens. 

## 1. PAUL SMITH
The English fashion icon has his [flagship store](## "negozio principale") in Covent Garden, selling men’s and women’s clothing and accessories with a background of art and furniture collections. Shoppers can also drink English [sparkling](## "spumoso") wine, [craft beer](## "birra artigianale") or Fortnum and Mason teas. There is an [in-house](## "interno") [monogramming](## "incisione delle iniziali") service, perfect for gifts.

## 2. DR. MARTENS
Once the favourite footwear of skinheads (featured in the film A Clockwork Orange), Doc Martens are now a global brand. The yellow and black classic boot is matched by the shop’s interior decoration. The design studio is in Camden Town. Neal Street is one of the [trendiest](## "più alla moda") locations in Covent Garden.  

## 3. GROSVENOR PRINTS
This antique [print shop](## "tipografia") has been in business for forty-five years. There are thousands of prints, some of them dating back to the 17th century, covering fields such as travel and exploration, [Fine Art](## "belle arti"), sports, portraits and natural history. The [knowledgeable](## "esperto") staff will [post](## "spedire") the prints to your home. 

## 4. STANFORDS
The world’s largest map and travel book retailer (or so it [claims](## "affermare")), the shop’s history goes back to 1853. You will also find a great collection of globes. Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott, social reformer Florence Nightingale — whose work during the Crimean War is credited with creating modern nursing —, and the British Army have all been customers. The shop has also featured in the stories of James Bond and Sherlock Holmes.

## 5. THE APPLE MARKET 
This historic building is now host to modern market traders. From Tuesday to Sunday, you will find stalls full of handmade crafts and goods, including jewellery, prints and [watercolours](## "acquerelli") On Monday there are antiques and [collectables](## "articoli da collezione"). The East Colonnade Market is on the east side of the building.
