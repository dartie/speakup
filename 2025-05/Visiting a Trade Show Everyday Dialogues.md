Bea: Thank you. I like to think we [deliver](## "fornire") a good service.
Oliver: ’m sure you do. So, are you looking for a cloud solution?

## NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!
A stand is a section of an exhibition where a company shows its products or services. It is sometimes called a [booth](## "stand").
To scout around means to look in different places to find something.
At an exhibition, a badge is the temporary identification document you usually wear around your [neck](## "collo"), showing your name, title and company and the type of [attendant](## "partecipante") you are – visitor, exhibitor or press.
Leading player refers to an important and successful company in a particular market.
Field is a generic term for an area of activity, like a technology, sector, market or industry.
If you want to state an opinion which is subjective (or even [hopeful](## "fiduciosa")), you can start by saying, “I like to think (that)…”
A cloud solution (or cloud-based solution) is a software or service that is provided and accessed through the internet, rather than [stored](## "archiviare") locally on a computer.
An exhibition can also be called a show or [fair](## "fiera"). If it is a professional exhibition, it can also be called a trade show or ‘trade [fair](## "fiera")’.
To catch your interest means to make you curious or interested.
Lead the way is a common phrase used to offer someone to go first and show you where to go.
