<p>Fans of Star Wars, the popular science fiction saga that began in 1977, celebrate Star Wars Day every year on 4 May. This date was chosen because of a <a href="##" title="gioco di parole">pun</a> on the film’s famous <a href="##" title="detto">saying</a> “<a href="##" title="che la forza ti accompagni">May the Force be with you</a>.” As everyone knows, Americans officially use the month/day/year format to write the date. Therefore, the date 4 May is ‘May 4th’ in America. <a href="##" title="scambiare">By swapping</a> the word ‘fourth’ for ‘force’… Get it? <a href="##" title="intelligente">A clever</a> play on words occurs! That’s how a new international event to celebrate everything Star Wars was born.</p>

<h2 id="a-british-pun">A BRITISH PUN</h2>

<p>Even though Star Wars was an an American movie that later became franchise, the Star Wars Day <a href="##" title="gioco di parole">pun</a> originated in the UK. On 4 May 1979 Margaret Thatcher was elected as Britain’s first female Prime Minister. To congratulate her, a British tabloid printed a half-page headline that read: “May the Fourth Be with You, Maggie.” British tabloids are famous for their wordplay, which contributes to their <a href="##" title="accattivante">eye-catching</a> headlines. Star Wars, released two years earlier, had made a huge cultural impact around the world. The play on words was easy to understand and the phrase quickly became popular. With the rise of the internet, the phrase <a href="##" title="diffondersi">spread</a> even more.</p>

<h2 id="may-the-fourth">MAY THE FOURTH</h2>

<p>On Star Wars Day, fans around the world enjoy different activities: they invite fellow Star Wars-obsessed friends to watch the whole original saga in a marathon viewing, dress up as their favourite characters, attend events and cosplay <a href="##" title="concorsi">contests</a>, play Star Wars video games or buy Star Wars merchandise at special discounts. Many also post Star Wars memes and jokes on social media using the hashtag #MayThe4thBeWithYou.</p>

<h2 id="to-canada-next">TO CANADA NEXT!</h2>

<p>The first official Star Wars Day event was <a href="##" title="avere luogo">held</a> in Toronto, Canada on 4 May 2011, with a costume contest and a film festival. Soon, more places <a href="##" title="partecipare">joined in</a>, and the celebration grew worldwide. In 2012, The Walt Disney Company bought Lucasfilm, the company that created Star Wars. Some fans worried that Star Wars Day would disappear, but the opposite happened: since 4 May 2013, Disney Parks have <a href="##" title="ospitare">hosted</a> official Star Wars events, including character <a href="##" title="pass VIP (lett. incontro e saluto)">meet-and-greets</a>, limited-edition merchandise <a href="##" title="uscite">releases</a>, Jedi training activities for kids, Star Wars-themed dance parties, and <a href="##" title="spettacoli di fuochi d’artificio">fireworks shows</a> set to Star Wars music.
What better way to celebrate than by <a href="##" title="afferrare">grabbing</a> a <a href="##" title="sciabola">lightsaber</a> and <a href="##" title="mettere in scena">staging</a> an epic battle between good and evil? And May the 4th be with you!  </p>

<h2 id="why-is-star-wars-so-popular">WHY IS STAR WARS SO POPULAR?</h2>

<p>Star Wars is one of the most successful movie franchises in history. It started in 1977 with the movie Star Wars: A New Hope, created by George Lucas. The story is about an epic battle between good (the Jedi and the Rebellion) and evil (the Sith and the Empire) in a galaxy far, far away. The ‘Force’ mentioned in its famous catchphrase ‘<a href="##" title="che la forza ti accompagni">May the Force be with you</a>’ is a mysterious energy field created by life that <a href="##" title="unire">binds the galaxy together</a>. <a href="##" title="sfruttare">Harnessing</a> the Force gives the Jedi extraordinary abilities. The <a href="##" title="lotta eterna">timeless struggle</a> of Star Wars has captivated viewers for decades because it had amazing special effects for its time and an unforgettable soundtrack by John Williams. But beyond its technical achievements, Star Wars offers a vast universe full of exciting characters and stories and has grown into a cultural phenomenon, inspiring millions of fans worldwide across generations.
