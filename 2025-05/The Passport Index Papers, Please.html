<p>How powerful is your passport? According to the Henley Passport Index, if you are Spanish or Italian you hold the third most powerful passport in the world. Yes, your <a href="##" title="di colore borgogna">burgundy-coloured</a> EU passport is greater than a navy blue British passport (ranked 5th) or a US passport (ranked 9th.) But the small nation of Singapore <a href="##" title="possedere">holds</a> the world’s most powerful passport, <a href="##" title="concedere">granting</a> visa-free access to 195 out of 227 global destinations. </p>

<h2 id="power-to-move">POWER TO MOVE</h2>

<p>Passport indexes rank countries based on the travel freedom their passports offer. There is more than one index: check out passportindex.org, for example, which has an attractive interactive website and app! However, the Henley Passport Index is considered the most accurate; since 2005, this index, run by a British investment migration <a href="##" title="consulenza">consultancy</a>, has used data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Updated every month, it ranks 199 passports in total, <a href="##" title="tenere in considerazione">factoring in</a> visa-free access, visas on arrival and electronic travel authorisations (ETAs). </p>

<h2 id="simple-tools">SIMPLE TOOLS</h2>

<p>Power rankings are revealing but they are also incomplete and can be <a href="##" title="ingannevoli">misleading</a>, as they are built on quantitive data, so small, remote territories such as Tristan da Cunha are given equal weight to big countries like France. According to Henley, their index is a <a href="##" title="utile">handy</a> reference tool as much for travellers as for government <a href="##" title="legislatori">policy-makers</a>. It illustrates the <a href="##" title="ampliare la distanza">widening gap</a> between top-ranking countries like Japan in 2nd place, and the least powerful, Afghanistan, whose citizens have access to only 27 destinations visa-free. </p>

<h2 id="born-un-free">BORN (UN)FREE</h2>

<p><a href="##" title="più ampie">The broader</a> implications of these rankings <a href="##" title="fare uso di">draw on</a> colonial history, immigration law, global trade and political trends like <a href="##" title="dazi">tariffs</a> and isolationism — a tendency of today’s US. Countries with stable, developed economies have greater travel freedom because their citizens are considered low-risk. Racism plays a role in keeping countries in their place: Germans or Canadians are not seen as potential illegal immigrants, for example, but it is a different story for Somalians or Libyans. Such rules and even indexes themselves may be part of the problem with their hierarchical approach and definition of power in these terms. </p>

<h2 id="heading-to-helsinki">HEADING TO HELSINKI</h2>

<p>An alternative way to rank countries is by how much citizens are happy to stay at home. Through its annual Freedom in the World report, the US-based NGO Freedom House ranks 210 countries or territories by their citizens’ access to political rights and civil liberties. Each are given a status <a href="##" title="punteggio">score</a> and the higher the <a href="##" title="punteggio">score</a>, the more ‘free’ a country is. On this index, Henley leader Singapore has a <a href="##" title="punteggio">score</a> of 48 and is called only “partly free.” Spain and Italy have <a href="##" title="punteggio">score</a>s of 90, one point below the UK. All are called “free”. The US (also “free”) has a <a href="##" title="punteggio">score</a> of 83. And <a href="##" title="nonostante">despite</a> its history of colonisation from Russia on one side and Sweden on the other, Finland tops the report with a <a href="##" title="punteggio">score</a> of 100!</p>

<h2 id="singapore-freedom-for-some">SINGAPORE: FREEDOM FOR SOME</h2>

<p>Just 750 square kilometres in size, Singapore has a parliamentary political system which has been dominated by the same party and the family of its current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, since 1959. The electoral and legal <a href="##" title="quadro">framework</a> allows for some political pluralism, but <a href="##" title="restrizioni">constrains</a> the growth of credible opposition parties and limits freedoms of expression, assembly and association.
The UK’s passport has fluctuated over the years and its power <a href="##" title="diminuire">has waned</a> over the last decade from its previous <a href="##" title="mantenuta a lungo">long-held</a> number one position — last held <a href="##" title="congiuntamente">jointly</a> with the US in 2014. It is now <a href="##" title="alla pari con">on a par with</a> Belgium, Portugal and Switzerland. The US has also <a href="##" title="scendere">dropped</a>, and is now, <a href="##" title="in parità">tied</a>with Estonia.
The Israeli passport has risen from 24th place to 19th place this year, while the passport of the Palestinian territories is ranked way down at 100.</p>
