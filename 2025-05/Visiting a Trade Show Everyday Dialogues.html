<h2 id="now-let-s-review-the-vocabulary">NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!</h2>

<p>A stand is a section of an exhibition where a company shows its products or services. It is sometimes called a <a href="##" title="stand">booth</a>.
To scout around means to look in different places to find something.
At an exhibition, a badge is the temporary identification document you usually wear around your <a href="##" title="collo">neck</a>, showing your name, title and company and the type of <a href="##" title="partecipante">attendant</a> you are – visitor, exhibitor or press.
Leading player refers to an important and successful company in a particular market.
Field is a generic term for an area of activity, like a technology, sector, market or industry.
If you want to state an opinion which is subjective (or even <a href="##" title="fiduciosa">hopeful</a>), you can start by saying, “I like to think (that)…”
A cloud solution (or cloud-based solution) is a software or service that is provided and accessed through the internet, rather than <a href="##" title="archiviare">stored</a> locally on a computer.
An exhibition can also be called a show or <a href="##" title="fiera">fair</a>. If it is a professional exhibition, it can also be called a trade show or ‘trade <a href="##" title="fiera">fair</a>’.
To catch your interest means to make you curious or interested.
Lead the way is a common phrase used to offer someone to go first and show you where to go.</p>
