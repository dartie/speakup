How powerful is your passport? According to the Henley Passport Index, if you are Spanish or Italian you hold the third most powerful passport in the world. Yes, your [burgundy-coloured](## "di colore borgogna") EU passport is greater than a navy blue British passport (ranked 5th) or a US passport (ranked 9th.) But the small nation of Singapore [holds](## "possedere") the world’s most powerful passport, [granting](## "concedere") visa-free access to 195 out of 227 global destinations. 

## POWER TO MOVE
Passport indexes rank countries based on the travel freedom their passports offer. There is more than one index: check out passportindex.org, for example, which has an attractive interactive website and app! However, the Henley Passport Index is considered the most accurate; since 2005, this index, run by a British investment migration [consultancy](## "consulenza"), has used data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Updated every month, it ranks 199 passports in total, [factoring in](## "tenere in considerazione") visa-free access, visas on arrival and electronic travel authorisations (ETAs). 

## SIMPLE TOOLS
Power rankings are revealing but they are also incomplete and can be [misleading](## "ingannevoli"), as they are built on quantitive data, so small, remote territories such as Tristan da Cunha are given equal weight to big countries like France. According to Henley, their index is a [handy](## "utile") reference tool as much for travellers as for government [policy-makers](## "legislatori"). It illustrates the [widening gap](## "ampliare la distanza") between top-ranking countries like Japan in 2nd place, and the least powerful, Afghanistan, whose citizens have access to only 27 destinations visa-free. 

## BORN (UN)FREE
[The broader](## "più ampie") implications of these rankings [draw on](## "fare uso di") colonial history, immigration law, global trade and political trends like [tariffs](## "dazi") and isolationism — a tendency of today’s US. Countries with stable, developed economies have greater travel freedom because their citizens are considered low-risk. Racism plays a role in keeping countries in their place: Germans or Canadians are not seen as potential illegal immigrants, for example, but it is a different story for Somalians or Libyans. Such rules and even indexes themselves may be part of the problem with their hierarchical approach and definition of power in these terms. 

## HEADING TO HELSINKI
An alternative way to rank countries is by how much citizens are happy to stay at home. Through its annual Freedom in the World report, the US-based NGO Freedom House ranks 210 countries or territories by their citizens’ access to political rights and civil liberties. Each are given a status [score](## "punteggio") and the higher the [score](## "punteggio"), the more ‘free’ a country is. On this index, Henley leader Singapore has a [score](## "punteggio") of 48 and is called only “partly free.” Spain and Italy have [score](## "punteggio")s of 90, one point below the UK. All are called “free”. The US (also “free”) has a [score](## "punteggio") of 83. And [despite](## "nonostante") its history of colonisation from Russia on one side and Sweden on the other, Finland tops the report with a [score](## "punteggio") of 100!

## SINGAPORE: FREEDOM FOR SOME
Just 750 square kilometres in size, Singapore has a parliamentary political system which has been dominated by the same party and the family of its current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, since 1959. The electoral and legal [framework](## "quadro") allows for some political pluralism, but [constrains](## "restrizioni") the growth of credible opposition parties and limits freedoms of expression, assembly and association.
The UK’s passport has fluctuated over the years and its power [has waned](## "diminuire") over the last decade from its previous [long-held](## "mantenuta a lungo") number one position — last held [jointly](## "congiuntamente") with the US in 2014. It is now [on a par with](## "alla pari con") Belgium, Portugal and Switzerland. The US has also [dropped](## "scendere"), and is now, [tied](## "in parità")with Estonia.
The Israeli passport has risen from 24th place to 19th place this year, while the passport of the Palestinian territories is ranked way down at 100.
