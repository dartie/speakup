<p>The lancet <a href="##" title="distoma lanceolato"><a href="##" title="fegato">liver</a> <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a></a> is a microscopic parasitic <a href="##" title="vermi piatti">flatworm</a> that turns ants into zombies. An ant accidentally eats a <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a> and the parasite migrates to the ant’s brain where it heads to the central nervous system and takes control. The <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a> causes the infected ant <a href="##" title="arrampicarsi">to climb</a> to the top of a <a href="##" title="filo d’erba">blade of grass</a> and <a href="##" title="posarsi">perch</a> there, dreamily awaiting its death. When <a href="##" title="bovini">cattle</a> or <a href="##" title="pecore">sheep</a> come <a href="##" title="pascolare">to graze</a>, they eat the grass together with the ant, and the <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a> worm settles into the larger animal’s <a href="##" title="fegato">liver</a>, doing terrible damage. A few months ago, I became convinced that one of these tiny demon parasites had migrated to the brain of my best friend, Pete.
This was my second hypothesis.
My first was that he was the subject of the other type of <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a>. When he fell off a <a href="##" title="scala">ladder</a> while painting his bedroom <a href="##" title="soffitto">ceiling</a>, I thought he’d been <a href="##" title="goffo, impacciato">clumsy</a>. When the very same week he fell out of a tree in his garden while trying to rescue his cat, I joked: “Third time lucky, eh, Pete?” The third time happened just five days later. Rather than call the maintenance people, Pete decided to walk out onto his <a href="##" title="tetto">roof</a> with a <a href="##" title="straccio">mop</a> and <a href="##" title="secchio">bucket</a> to clean his solar panels. The wet panels were very <a href="##" title="scivoloso">slippery</a>. Pete <a href="##" title="perdere l’equilibrio, cadere">missed his footing</a>, fell and <a href="##" title="strisciare">slithered</a> uncontrollably off the <a href="##" title="tetto">roof</a> into the branches of the same tree the cat had got stuck in. That was the first time I mentioned the word ‘<a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a>’ — not as in a parasitic worm, but as in an unlikely <a href="##" title="evento fortuito">chance occurrence</a>, or a surprising piece of luck: three <a href="##" title="brutte">nasty</a> falls and all Pete had <a href="##" title="avere come conseguenza">to show for it</a> were a few <a href="##" title="graffi">scratches</a>. A <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a> indeed!
It worried me that Pete wasn’t <a href="##" title="prestare attenzione">heeding</a> these clear cosmic warnings. Surely someone who had fallen three times in less than a <a href="##" title="due settimane">fortnight</a> would start avoiding high places. Not Pete. Whenever I mentioned that his good luck might <a href="##" title="esaurirsi">run out</a>, he just <a href="##" title="ridacchiare">chuckled</a> and smiled dreamily. That was when I began to wonder if something was wrong with him.
After the incident with the solar panels, Pete fell from a <a href="##" title="finestra del secondo piano">second storey window</a> while trying to clean the glass on the outside. He slipped from a <a href="##" title="cima della scogliera">clifftop</a> path while walking along the coast on a particularly windy day. He <a href="##" title="cadere">took another dive</a> from his <a href="##" title="tetto">roof</a> while trying to reorientate his satellite dish and he fell out of another tree — this time while trying to reach the <a href="##" title="più mature">ripest</a> cherries on the <a href="##" title="più alte">topmost</a> branches.
This last accident dislocated his shoulder and I really thought he’d start to <a href="##" title="ragionare">see sense</a>. But when I warned him that he should be more careful, he just smiled again and said: “You know what, I’ve decided I really like climbing. I love being up there above the world. I’m thinking of doing a <a href="##" title="arrampicata libera">free-climbing</a> course.
“Don’t do it, mate!” I <a href="##" title="esortare">urged</a>. “Think of all the <a href="##" title="occasioni in cui è stato vicino ad avere un incidente">near misses</a> you’ve had. It’s a <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a> that you’re still alive.”
A few hours later I learned the other definition of ‘<a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a>’ and formed my second hypothesis. I was watching a nature documentary on TV and the name ‘lancet <a href="##" title="distoma lanceolato"><a href="##" title="fegato">liver</a> <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a></a>’ caught my attention, because I’d used that very word with Pete not long before. When I saw the ant on my TV screen, hanging dreamily from a tall <a href="##" title="filo d’erba">blade of grass</a> waiting to be eaten, I had a sudden vision of Pete <a href="##" title="penzolare">dangling</a> from the branch of a tree. “Oh my God,” I <a href="##" title="ridacchiare">chuckled</a> <a href="##" title="ad alta voce">aloud</a> — at this point I was still laughing — “a <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a> worm has got into Pete’s brain!”
But the funny side quickly disappeared. Pete was arrested twice for scaling the fire escapes of tall buildings in the middle of the night. Another time he was caught trying <a href="##" title="arrampicarsi">to climb</a> up the suspension cables of Tower Bridge. Fortunately, some tourists <a href="##" title="trascinare via">dragged him off</a> before he could get too far. That time he was almost <a href="##" title="ricoverare">sectioned</a>, but I didn’t believe Pete’s mental health was the problem. I was convinced the culprit was the lancet <a href="##" title="distoma lanceolato"><a href="##" title="fegato">liver</a> <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a></a>. According to the internet, the <a href="##" title="colpo di fortuna">fluke</a> doesn’t bother with human brains, it goes straight to the <a href="##" title="fegato">liver</a> and victims suffer from hepatitis-like symptoms. <a href="##" title="è vero che">Admittedly</a>, Pete had none of those, but the <a href="##" title="distante">faraway</a> expression that came over his face whenever he talked about his various escapades, his <a href="##" title="ipnotizzato">mesmerised</a> climbing, made me think of that ant on my TV screen.
Unfortunately, we will never know the truth, as Pete’s body has never been found. On his final climb he managed to scale the central pylon of the London <a href="##" title="funivia">cable car</a> at Greenwich. He’d gone very early in the morning and climbed all the way to the top. I imagine him smiling as he watched the sun rise over London’s East End. I know he was smiling, because the tourists who came up in the first <a href="##" title="funivia">cable car</a> later described it: Pete’s euphoric face as <a href="##" title="dondolare">he swung</a> out in front of them, seconds before their <a href="##" title="funivia">cable car</a>, <a href="##" title="ostinato">obdurate</a> and <a href="##" title="con lo sguardo perso">glassy-eyed</a> like a mechanical <a href="##" title="pecore">sheep</a>, smashed into him, <a href="##" title="sbattere contro">knocking him into</a> the Thames. </p>
