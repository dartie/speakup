Every year, [green-fingered](## "avere il pollice verde") enthusiasts and professional gardeners [descend upon](## "accorrere") the Chelsea Flower Show. Also known as the Great Spring Show, this five-day event is held annually in May in the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, in Chelsea, West London. Chelsea has been home to the event since 1912, but the Great Spring Show actually began in 1862, when it was held in the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) garden in Kensington, situated in the neighbouring Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Before this, the RHS organised various flower shows in the West London district of Chiswick from 1833 [onwards](## "da quel momento in poi").

## EMERGING TRENDS
The Chelsea Flower Show is not only a chance [to brush up](## "rinfrescare") on your horticultural knowledge but also an opportunity to learn about innovation, design and emerging trends in the gardening industry. It is a [staple](## "evento fisso") in the royal calendar, with the [late](## "defunta") Queen Elizabeth II known to be one of the show’s greatest admirers.

## SUSTAINABILITY
As of 2023, all gardens shown at the Chelsea Flower Show have to be either [relocated](## "ricollocare"), reused, or [repurposed](## "riutilizzare") as part of the show’s sustainability strategy. This means that many of the gardens from previous editions of the show can be enjoyed at various locations around the UK. For example, the National Autistic Society Garden, by the River Ayr in Scotland, is the 2024 [silver-gilt](## "argento dorato") medal winner, a space designed by Sophie Parmenter and Dido Milne [to showcase](## "mostrare") the idea [of masking](## "mascherare") symptoms of autism in everyday life. And garden designer Holly Johnson’s The Bridgerton Garden, a 2024 silver-medal-winning concept inspired by the [wallflower-like](## "simile alla brutta del ballo") character of Penelope Featherington in the hit series Bridgerton, can now be found in Cambridge University Hospital’s Rosie Garden.

## INSPIRATIONAL
From gardening [tips](## "consigli") for small spaces to gardens designed with specific concepts in mind, the Chelsea Flower Show is sure to inspire [budding](## "alle prime armi") gardeners, [whatever size](## "indipendentemente dalle dimensioni") their garden, patio or balcony may be. [Fine-dining](## "alta cucina") experiences are also offered for those wishing to try [British-sourced produce](## "prodotti agricoli di origine britannica") during the show. One thing’s for sure; even if you’re not into gardening, after attending this event, [it’ll grow on you](## "ti piacerà alla fine")!
