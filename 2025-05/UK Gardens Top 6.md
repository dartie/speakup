When the British are not busy in their own gardens, they’re often out visiting other people’s. The UK has the finest collection of historic parks, gardens, [estates](## "proprietà") and designed landscapes in the world. Here are six of the best:
Abandoned and [overgrown](## "trascurati") after World War One, The Lost Gardens of Heligan have been transformed into one of the UK’s most enchanting attractions. Located near the Eden Project in Cornwall, this historic estate, with its warm microclimate, [boast](## "vantarsi di") eighty hectares of breathtaking landscapes, from Victorian gardens to luxuriant subtropical jungle. Winding paths4 lead through [towering](## "imponenti") [tree ferns](## "felci arboree"), exotic plants, and romantic walled gardens, offering visitors a [glimpse](## "sguardo") into 19th-century horticulture. The garden’s restoration, following its rediscovery in the 1990s, is a moving masterpiece of regeneration, rewilding — and a must-see for nature lovers.
A Unesco World Heritage Site, a botanical wonderland in the heart of London, Kew Gardens is one of the UK’s best-known gardens and offers visitors something of everything. Home to the world’s largest and most diverse collection of plants, its 120-hectare landscape features the iconic Temperate House, a vast Victorian [glasshouse](## "serra"), and the [Treetop Walkway](## "passerella tra gli alberi"), offering [stunning](## "mozzafiato") aerial views. The Princess of Wales Conservatory [showcases](## "mostrare") ten climate zones, from arid deserts to humid rainforests. With [ongoing](## "in corso") conservation work and scientific research, as well as the world’s largest seed conservation project, magical Kew is more than just a garden — it’s a [hub](## "centro") of global plant discovery.
Lovingly created in the glorious countryside of the Kent Weald by writer Vita Sackville-West and her husband Harold Nicolson, Sissinghurst Castle Garden is one of England’s most romantic gardens. Designed as a series of intimate rooms, each with its own theme, the garden is famed for its spectacular White Garden and vibrant rose displays. The carefully-curated planting schemes [blend](## "mescolanza") structure and wildness, romance and restraint, embodying the English cottage garden aesthetic. Surrounded by the remains of a Tudor estate, Sissinghurst offers a poetic escape into beauty and history.
[Set against the spectacular backdrop](## "con lo sfondo di") of Eryri (Snowdonia) and the River Conwy, Bodnant Garden provides a masterclass in horticultural design. Established in the late 19th century, it [boast](## "vantarsi di")s [stunning](## "mozzafiato") terraces, a world-famous Laburnum Arch, and a [sprawling](## "vasta") wild, woodland valley. Rare plants from across the globe [thrive](## "prosperare") here, thanks to generations of careful cultivation. Spring sees rhododendrons and magnolias [burst](## "esplodere") into colour, while autumn transforms the landscape into a [tapestry](## "arazzo") of gold and [crimson](## "cremisi").
[Nestled](## "incastonati") on the [shores](## "rive") of Loch Fyne, the gardens of Inveraray Castle [blend](## "mescolanza") natural beauty with formal elegance. The 6.5-hectare grounds feature manicured lawns, ornamental borders, and ancient trees, framed by the [rugged](## "accidentato") Argyll landscape. The woodland [trails](## "sentieri") lead to breathtaking viewpoints, while the walled garden is filled with vibrant seasonal [blooms](## "fioriture"). A visit here offers not just horticultural [delights](## "delizie") but also a [glimpse](## "sguardo") into Scotland’s aristocratic history, with the grand 18th-century castle as a magnificent backdrop.
One of the UK’s most celebrated gardens, and voted one of the world’s top ten gardens, Mount Stewart is a paradise of [bold](## "audaci") colour and exotic planting. It was created by Edith, [Marchioness](## "marchesa") of Londonderry, in the early 20th century, and the garden reflects her artistic vision and love for Mediterranean-style landscapes. A [tapestry](## "arazzo") of design [woven together](## "intrecciare") with love and expertise, Mount Stewart combines Italianate terraces, lush woodland, and serene lake walks. Thanks to County Down’s mild climate, unusual plants flourish here, creating an enchanting and [ever-changing](## "in continuo cambiamento") year-round display.
