<p>There are many dates associated with the founding of the United States, but the most famous is 4 July. This was the date in 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was <a href="##" title="emettere, promulgare">issued</a>. Celebrated every year as a federal holiday, Independence Day, or simply the Fourth of July, is considered to be the <a href="##" title="nascita">birth</a> date of the nation.</p>

<h2 id="a-revolutionary-act">A Revolutionary Act</h2>

<p>The Declaration of Independence was not legally <a href="##" title="vincolante">binding</a>, but it is still one of the most powerful documents in US history. It was adopted by the Second Continental Congress, a meeting of delegates from the thirteen British colonies, all located on the east coast of North America. The meeting took place at Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia, America’s revolutionary capital at the time; the document formalised the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), a military conflict in which American forces <a href="##" title="infine">eventually</a> defeated the British to secure US independence.</p>

<h2 id="the-founding-fathers">The Founding Fathers</h2>

<p>The Declaration was the first formal declaration by a nation’s <a href="##" title="popolo">people</a> <a href="##" title="affermare, far valere">asserting</a> their right to choose their own government. It announced the separation of the thirteen colonies from Great Britain as independent <a href="##" title="sovrani">sovereign</a> states. It was written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, who became President of the United States in 1801. It was signed by the meeting’s fifty-six delegates, who came to be known as the nation’s Founding Fathers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>**“We <strong><a href="##" title="considerare">hold</a></strong> these truths to be <strong><a href="##" title="più che evidenti, ovvie">self-evident</a></strong>, that all men are created equal, that they are <strong><a href="##" title="dotare">endowed</a></strong> by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the <strong><a href="##" title="ricerca della felicità">pursuit of happiness</a></strong>”.**</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="abraham-lincoln">Abraham Lincoln </h2>

<p>At the time, the British government <a href="##" title="fare del proprio meglio">did its best</a> <a href="##" title="respingere">to dismiss</a> the Declaration as a <a href="##" title="privo di senso">meaningless</a> document. It was not until 1783 that American independence was recognised and <a href="##" title="frontiere">borders</a> established for the new nation. It was, in fact, Abraham Lincoln, US President from 1861 to 1865, who popularised the Declaration. He made it the <a href="##" title="fulcro">centrepiece</a> of his <a href="##" title="politiche">policies</a>, and often <a href="##" title="citare">quoted</a> from it in his speeches. </p>

<h2 id="the-charters-of-freedom-carte-della-libertà">The <a href="##" title="Carte della Libertà">Charters of Freedom</a></h2>

<p>The US Declaration of Independence <a href="##" title="dichiarare">stated</a> the principles on which the American government and the American identity are based. It is <a href="##" title="esposta">on display</a> at the National Archives Building in Washington, DC, along with the US Constitution and the <a href="##" title="Carta dei Diritti">Bill of Rights</a>. These three documents, known collectively as the <a href="##" title="Carte della Libertà">Charters of Freedom</a>, are considered fundamental in <a href="##" title="plasmare">shaping</a> the foundation and philosophy of the United States.</p>
