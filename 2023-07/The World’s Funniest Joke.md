# The World’s Funniest Joke   [B1]

L’umorismo si definisce come la capacità di percepire ed esprimere qualcosa di divertente. Nel migliore dei casi una battuta viene accolta con una risata. Ma il senso dell’umorismo è soggettivo, sia culturalmente, sia a livello individuale: è possibile individuare la miglior barzelletta del mondo?

The 1969 pilot of the now-iconic British comedy show Monty Python’s F[lying](## "giacere") Circus ended in a sketch called “The funniest joke in the world”. In it, a man invents a joke so funny that he literally dies laughing. During the Second World War, the joke is used by the British military as a [deadly](## "mortale") weapon. It proves extremely effective, even in translation, [wiping out](## "sterminare") [scores](## "un mucchio") of Nazis while Allied forces protect themselves by covering their ears.

## A Revolutionary Act
[Laughter](## "risata") is usually thought to be beneficial to our health. Laughing can be a [coping](## "modo di superare") strategy at times of crisis, while laughter therapy and laughter yoga are both based on the [belief](## "idea") that humour has physiological and psychological benefits. What makes us laugh is subjective, however. Finding one joke that everyone laughs at is [surely](## "sicuramente") impossible.

## LAUGH LAB
In 2001, best-selling British writer and psychologist Richard Wiseman hoped to prove that such a joke did exist. He [teamed up](## "unirsi, collaborare") with the British Science Association for a study named LaughLab — the scientific search for the world’s funniest joke. By the end of the project, forty thousand jokes had been [submitted](## "presentare"), including some gene[rated](## "valutare") by artificial intelligence. The jokes were [rated](## "valutare") on a scale of 1 (bad) to 5 ([hilarious](## "divertentissima")) by more than 350,000 people from seventy countries. 

## COUCH HUMOUR
The winning joke came from a British psychiatrist called Gurpal Gosall. He appeared [to prove Wiseman right](## "dare ragione"); the joke, Gosall said, was one he told his patients to help them gain perspective on their problems. [It went like this](## "recitava così"): “Two hunters are out in the [woods](## "boschi") when one of them [collapses](## "crollarena terra"). He doesn’t seem to be breathing and his [eyes are glazed](## "occhi vitrei"). The other guy [whips out](## "tirare fuori") his phone and calls the emergency services. He [gasps](## "parlare ansimando"), “My friend is dead! What can I do?”. The operator says “Calm down. I can help. First, let’s [make sure](## "assicurarsi") he’s dead.” There is a silence, then a [shot](## "sparo") is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says “OK, now what?”

## CULTURE CLASH
While the world has become more globalised (if [arguably](## "verosimilmente") more absurd) since, recent research has shown that there are still significant cultural differences when it comes to humour. In a 2019 study by psychologists in Hong Kong, a country with [close ties](## "stretti legami") to both Britain and China, they found that while in the [West](## "l’Occidente") humour is taken seriously as something that [enhances](## "aumentare") [well-being](## "benessere"), in the [East](## "l’Oriente") it is viewed as trivial, and as such less likely to be effective as a [coping](## "modo di superare") strategy or as therapy.

## PUBLIC REACTIONS
Even in the [West](## "l’Occidente") the same joke can be received very differently, depending on where you’re from. Monty Python were four Englishmen (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin), one [Welshman](## "gallese") (Terry Jones) and one American (Terry Gilliam). The four-series show, which ended in 1974, was a mas - sive hit in both the UK and the US and was also highly [rated](## "valutare") in the Netherlands and in Japan. [Yet](## "tuttavia") as research into public reactions revealed, audiences in the UK and in the US, for example, laughed at different parts of the exact same sketch.

## THE GOONS
Some years after LaughLab had concluded, Wiseman made a discovery. That winning joke by Gosall was actually a version of one written by Irish comedian Spike Milligan back in 1951. Milligan was a member of a comedy trio called the [Goons](## "stupidi, idioti"), with British actors Michael Bentine and Peter Sellers. The joke was a dialogue between the [latter](## "questi ultimi") two men. [It went like this](## "recitava così"):
**Michael Bentine**: I just came in and found him [lying](## "giacere") on the [carpet](## "tappeto") there.
**Peter Sellers**: Oh, is he dead? 
**Michael Bentine**: [I think so](## "penso di sì"). 
**Peter Sellers**: [Hadn’t you better](## "non faresti meglio a...?") [make sure](## "assicurarsi")? 
**Michael Bentine**: Alright. Just a minute. Sound of two gun [shot](## "sparo")s. 
**Michael Bentine**: He’s dead.
Wiseman was [stunned](## "sbalordito"). Milligan was by then a controversial figure: a comic genius for some, he was also [prone to](## "incline a") making [unpleasant](## "spiacevoli") and even racist [remarks](## "commenti"). [Nevertheless](## "comunque, ciononostante"), this one morbid joke by Milligan is still considered to be the closest thing we have to a ‘humour pill’: the funniest and most therapeutic joke in the world.
