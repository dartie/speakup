<p>Costretto in sedia a rotelle per gran parte della sua vita e in grado di parlare solo per mezzo di un sintetizzatore vocale, è stato una delle menti più brillanti della storia. Con la sua forza di volontà, la potenza intellettuale e il talento per la divulgazione, ha aperto nuovi orizzonti alla cosmologia.</p>

<p>The brilliant physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking died on 14 March 2018, aged seventy-six, after living with <a href="##" title="sclerosi laterale amiotrofica (SLA)">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</a> for more than fifty years. The illness slowly paralysed him, finally leaving him <a href="##" title="inerme">helpless</a> in a wheelchair, able to communicate only through a speech-generating <a href="##" title="apparecchio">device</a> with an American accent — which he hated. His <a href="##" title="intuizioni, idee">insights</a> shaped modern cosmology and inspired global audiences in their millions.</p>

<h2 id="eccentric-family">Eccentric Family</h2>

<p>Hawking came from a highly intelligent, eccentric family. <a href="##" title="durante i pasti">At mealtimes</a>, everyone ate while reading books. The family travelled in a converted London taxi. Hawking was called ‘Einstein’ at school. In 1965, aged just twenty-three, while studying at Cambridge University for his mathematics <a href="##" title="dottorato (Doctor of Philosophy)">PhD</a>, he was diagnosed with an <a href="##" title="insorgenza precoce">early-onset</a>, slow-progressing form of ALS and given only two years to live. </p>

<h2 id="hard-times">Hard Times</h2>

<p>Hawking then married Jane Wilde, a <a href="##" title="compagna">fellow</a> student. As his physical condition <a href="##" title="peggiorare">worsened</a> over the years, Jane <a href="##" title="prendersi cura">looked after</a> him as well as their three children. When the scientist became world famous, after the global success of his book A Brief History of Time (1988), life became even more complicated. Jane found herself <a href="##" title="circondare">surrounded</a> by nurses and assistants, as well as trying to <a href="##" title="affrontare">cope</a> with his celebrity. Hawking left her in 1995 for his principal nurse. Jane and the family were worried later that Hawking was suffering physical abuse.</p>

<h2 id="scientific-career">Scientific Career</h2>

<p>Hawking is famous, of course, for his scientific work, especially on black holes. He spent his lifetime trying to understand the universe. He wanted a complete theory. Hawking predicted that black holes emitted radiation (often called ‘Hawking radiation’). This was an enormous <a href="##" title="progresso">breakthrough</a> in theoretical physics. His work on black holes proved the idea of a Big Bang at the birth of the Universe, and attracted great public interest. He was also the first <a href="##" title="enunciare">to set out</a> a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and <a href="##" title="meccanica quantica">quantum mechanics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>**“We are just a <strong><a href="##" title="leggermente">slightly</a></strong> advanced <strong><a href="##" title="specie">breed</a></strong> of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting an <strong><a href="##" title="stella normale, nella media">average star</a></strong>. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special”**</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="unread-bestseller">Unread Bestseller</h2>

<p>Hawking is also famous for one of the best-known science books ever written, A Brief History of Time. The Hawkings needed money for their children’s education and home <a href="##" title="spese">expenses</a>. The scientist decided to write a popular book about the universe for the general public. His book was a worldwide bestseller, but many people consider it to be one of the leading unread books of all time, alongside James Joyce’s Ulysses or Cervantes’ Don Quixote!</p>

<h2 id="confined-but-free">Confined but Free</h2>

<p>Confined to a wheelchair for most of his life, with increasingly serious problems of communication, Hawking <a href="##" title="essere determinato">set his mind</a> to travel the universe, producing ideas that advanced the theories of Einstein — when he should have been dead decades before. On his death, Hawking was cremated and his <a href="##" title="ceneri">ashes</a> were <a href="##" title="seppellire">interred</a> in Westminster Abbey between the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin: three geniuses <a href="##" title="di fila">in a row</a>.</p>
