# A Mind Travelling in Space: Stephen Hawking   [B2]

Costretto in sedia a rotelle per gran parte della sua vita e in grado di parlare solo per mezzo di un sintetizzatore vocale, è stato una delle menti più brillanti della storia. Con la sua forza di volontà, la potenza intellettuale e il talento per la divulgazione, ha aperto nuovi orizzonti alla cosmologia.

The brilliant physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking died on 14 March 2018, aged seventy-six, after living with [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)](## "sclerosi laterale amiotrofica (SLA)") for more than fifty years. The illness slowly paralysed him, finally leaving him [helpless](## "inerme") in a wheelchair, able to communicate only through a speech-generating [device](## "apparecchio") with an American accent — which he hated. His [insights](## "intuizioni, idee") shaped modern cosmology and inspired global audiences in their millions.

## Eccentric Family
Hawking came from a highly intelligent, eccentric family. [At mealtimes](## "durante i pasti"), everyone ate while reading books. The family travelled in a converted London taxi. Hawking was called ‘Einstein’ at school. In 1965, aged just twenty-three, while studying at Cambridge University for his mathematics [PhD](## "dottorato (Doctor of Philosophy)"), he was diagnosed with an [early-onset](## "insorgenza precoce"), slow-progressing form of ALS and given only two years to live. 

## Hard Times
Hawking then married Jane Wilde, a [fellow](## "compagna") student. As his physical condition [worsened](## "peggiorare") over the years, Jane [looked after](## "prendersi cura") him as well as their three children. When the scientist became world famous, after the global success of his book A Brief History of Time (1988), life became even more complicated. Jane found herself [surrounded](## "circondare") by nurses and assistants, as well as trying to [cope](## "affrontare") with his celebrity. Hawking left her in 1995 for his principal nurse. Jane and the family were worried later that Hawking was suffering physical abuse.

## Scientific Career
Hawking is famous, of course, for his scientific work, especially on black holes. He spent his lifetime trying to understand the universe. He wanted a complete theory. Hawking predicted that black holes emitted radiation (often called ‘Hawking radiation’). This was an enormous [breakthrough](## "progresso") in theoretical physics. His work on black holes proved the idea of a Big Bang at the birth of the Universe, and attracted great public interest. He was also the first [to set out](## "enunciare") a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and [quantum mechanics](## "meccanica quantica").


>**“We are just a **[slightly](## "leggermente")** advanced **[breed](## "specie")** of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting an **[average star](## "stella normale, nella media")**. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special”**




## Unread Bestseller
Hawking is also famous for one of the best-known science books ever written, A Brief History of Time. The Hawkings needed money for their children’s education and home [expenses](## "spese"). The scientist decided to write a popular book about the universe for the general public. His book was a worldwide bestseller, but many people consider it to be one of the leading unread books of all time, alongside James Joyce’s Ulysses or Cervantes’ Don Quixote!

## Confined but Free
Confined to a wheelchair for most of his life, with increasingly serious problems of communication, Hawking [set his mind](## "essere determinato") to travel the universe, producing ideas that advanced the theories of Einstein — when he should have been dead decades before. On his death, Hawking was cremated and his [ashes](## "ceneri") were [interred](## "seppellire") in Westminster Abbey between the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin: three geniuses [in a row](## "di fila").
