<p>L’umorismo si definisce come la capacità di percepire ed esprimere qualcosa di divertente. Nel migliore dei casi una battuta viene accolta con una risata. Ma il senso dell’umorismo è soggettivo, sia culturalmente, sia a livello individuale: è possibile individuare la miglior barzelletta del mondo?</p>

<p>The 1969 pilot of the now-iconic British comedy show Monty Python’s F<a href="##" title="giacere">lying</a> Circus ended in a sketch called “The funniest joke in the world”. In it, a man invents a joke so funny that he literally dies laughing. During the Second World War, the joke is used by the British military as a <a href="##" title="mortale">deadly</a> weapon. It proves extremely effective, even in translation, <a href="##" title="sterminare">wiping out</a> <a href="##" title="un mucchio">scores</a> of Nazis while Allied forces protect themselves by covering their ears.</p>

<h2 id="a-revolutionary-act">A Revolutionary Act</h2>

<p><a href="##" title="risata">Laughter</a> is usually thought to be beneficial to our health. Laughing can be a <a href="##" title="modo di superare">coping</a> strategy at times of crisis, while laughter therapy and laughter yoga are both based on the <a href="##" title="idea">belief</a> that humour has physiological and psychological benefits. What makes us laugh is subjective, however. Finding one joke that everyone laughs at is <a href="##" title="sicuramente">surely</a> impossible.</p>

<h2 id="laugh-lab">LAUGH LAB</h2>

<p>In 2001, best-selling British writer and psychologist Richard Wiseman hoped to prove that such a joke did exist. He <a href="##" title="unirsi, collaborare">teamed up</a> with the British Science Association for a study named LaughLab — the scientific search for the world’s funniest joke. By the end of the project, forty thousand jokes had been <a href="##" title="presentare">submitted</a>, including some gene<a href="##" title="valutare">rated</a> by artificial intelligence. The jokes were <a href="##" title="valutare">rated</a> on a scale of 1 (bad) to 5 (<a href="##" title="divertentissima">hilarious</a>) by more than 350,000 people from seventy countries. </p>

<h2 id="couch-humour">COUCH HUMOUR</h2>

<p>The winning joke came from a British psychiatrist called Gurpal Gosall. He appeared <a href="##" title="dare ragione">to prove Wiseman right</a>; the joke, Gosall said, was one he told his patients to help them gain perspective on their problems. <a href="##" title="recitava così">It went like this</a>: “Two hunters are out in the <a href="##" title="boschi">woods</a> when one of them <a href="##" title="crollarena terra">collapses</a>. He doesn’t seem to be breathing and his <a href="##" title="occhi vitrei">eyes are glazed</a>. The other guy <a href="##" title="tirare fuori">whips out</a> his phone and calls the emergency services. He <a href="##" title="parlare ansimando">gasps</a>, “My friend is dead! What can I do?”. The operator says “Calm down. I can help. First, let’s <a href="##" title="assicurarsi">make sure</a> he’s dead.” There is a silence, then a <a href="##" title="sparo">shot</a> is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says “OK, now what?”</p>

<h2 id="culture-clash">CULTURE CLASH</h2>

<p>While the world has become more globalised (if <a href="##" title="verosimilmente">arguably</a> more absurd) since, recent research has shown that there are still significant cultural differences when it comes to humour. In a 2019 study by psychologists in Hong Kong, a country with <a href="##" title="stretti legami">close ties</a> to both Britain and China, they found that while in the <a href="##" title="l’Occidente">West</a> humour is taken seriously as something that <a href="##" title="aumentare">enhances</a> <a href="##" title="benessere">well-being</a>, in the <a href="##" title="l’Oriente">East</a> it is viewed as trivial, and as such less likely to be effective as a <a href="##" title="modo di superare">coping</a> strategy or as therapy.</p>

<h2 id="public-reactions">PUBLIC REACTIONS</h2>

<p>Even in the <a href="##" title="l’Occidente">West</a> the same joke can be received very differently, depending on where you’re from. Monty Python were four Englishmen (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin), one <a href="##" title="gallese">Welshman</a> (Terry Jones) and one American (Terry Gilliam). The four-series show, which ended in 1974, was a mas - sive hit in both the UK and the US and was also highly <a href="##" title="valutare">rated</a> in the Netherlands and in Japan. <a href="##" title="tuttavia">Yet</a> as research into public reactions revealed, audiences in the UK and in the US, for example, laughed at different parts of the exact same sketch.</p>

<h2 id="the-goons">THE GOONS</h2>

<p>Some years after LaughLab had concluded, Wiseman made a discovery. That winning joke by Gosall was actually a version of one written by Irish comedian Spike Milligan back in 1951. Milligan was a member of a comedy trio called the <a href="##" title="stupidi, idioti">Goons</a>, with British actors Michael Bentine and Peter Sellers. The joke was a dialogue between the <a href="##" title="questi ultimi">latter</a> two men. <a href="##" title="recitava così">It went like this</a>:
<strong>Michael Bentine</strong>: I just came in and found him <a href="##" title="giacere">lying</a> on the <a href="##" title="tappeto">carpet</a> there.
<strong>Peter Sellers</strong>: Oh, is he dead? 
<strong>Michael Bentine</strong>: <a href="##" title="penso di sì">I think so</a>. 
<strong>Peter Sellers</strong>: <a href="##" title="non faresti meglio a...?">Hadn’t you better</a> <a href="##" title="assicurarsi">make sure</a>? 
<strong>Michael Bentine</strong>: Alright. Just a minute. Sound of two gun <a href="##" title="sparo">shot</a>s. 
<strong>Michael Bentine</strong>: He’s dead.
Wiseman was <a href="##" title="sbalordito">stunned</a>. Milligan was by then a controversial figure: a comic genius for some, he was also <a href="##" title="incline a">prone to</a> making <a href="##" title="spiacevoli">unpleasant</a> and even racist <a href="##" title="commenti">remarks</a>. <a href="##" title="comunque, ciononostante">Nevertheless</a>, this one morbid joke by Milligan is still considered to be the closest thing we have to a ‘humour pill’: the funniest and most therapeutic joke in the world.</p>
