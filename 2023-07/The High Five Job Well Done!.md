# The High Five: Job Well Done!   [A2]

Questo gesto, una via di mezzo fra una celebrazione e un saluto, sembra un’espressione naturale di esultanza e di spirito di squadra, ma fino a pochi decenni fa non lo faceva nessuno. Come e quando ha avuto origine?

Watch any sporting competition today and it’s hard to believe that until about forty years ago the “high five” simply didn’t exist! [Although](## "sebbene") there are different versions of the origins of this instantly recognisable — but very American — gesture of [greeting](## "saluto") / celebration, many believe that the [first-ever](## "Il primo nella storia") high five happened during a baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros. 

## Baseball
It was 2 October 1977 and the last game of the season. Dusty Baker, a star player for the Dodgers, had just [hit](## "battere") a [home run](## "fuoricampo (battuta fuori dai limiti)"). To celebrate, he [rushed](## "correre") [towards](## "verso") his [teammates](## "compagni di squadra"), where the first person to meet him was player Glenn Burke, who [raised](## "alzare") his right arm with an open hand. Baker automatically [reached up](## "alzare il braccio") and [hit](## "battere") Burke’s hand: “It seemed like the thing to do”, he commented [afterwards](## "in seguito"). This gesture soon [spread](## "diffondersi") to other American sports, and then around the world thanks to the TV coverage of major sporting events. As its popularity escalated, it [broke out](## "superare, sconfinare") of the sporting [realm](## "ambito") and began to be used for any celebratory moment. 

## Vietnam Vets
There is, of course, another story [related](## "connessa,	in relazione") to its origins. Lamont Sleets was a [high-profile](## "d’alto profilo, rinomata") [college](## "università") basketball player who would often high five his [teammates](## "compagni di squadra"). When asked why, he explained that his father had served in the Vietnam War in a unit [nicknamed](## "soprannominata") The Five.  When, years later, the veterans [met up](## "riunirsi, incontrarsi"), they would always [stretch out](## "allungare, tendere") their arm, [spread](## "diffondersi") their five fingers and [slap](## "colpire a mano aperta") each other’s hands, [yelling](## "gridare") “Five!”. At the time, Lamont was a kid, but he loved the gesture of camaraderie and began to imitate it. 

## Jazz Culture
[Whichever](## "qualunque") story is true, today it is also commonly understood that the high five was an evolution of the [lesser-known](## "meno noto") low five. This [nonchalant](## "disinvolto") [greeting](## "saluto") had been a part of African-American jazz culture since [at least](## "almeno") the 1920s, and consisted of two people [slap](## "colpire a mano aperta")ping each other’s lowered hands. The [noun](## "nome") ‘high five’ entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1980; and the verb ‘to high five (someone)’ was [added](## "aggiungere") the next year. No matter how and when this worldwide cultural phenomenon originated, nothing seems [to convey](## "trasmettere, esprimere") the message “Job well done!” as perfectly as a [loud](## "forte, sonoro") and enthusiastic high five.
