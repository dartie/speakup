<p>Born in 1818, Emily Jane Brontë was the fifth of six children brought up in the small town of Haworth, Yorkshire, where their father was an Anglican <a href="##" title="pastore">parson</a>. <a href="##" title="orfana di madre">Motherless</a> from <a href="##" title="prima infanzia">infancy</a>, Emily was sent to Cowan Bridge School with her sisters Maria, Elizabeth and Charlotte, but was taken out of school after her two eldest sisters became ill with tuberculosis and died. The rest of Emily’s early education took place mostly at home.</p>

<h2 id="highly-sensitive">HIGHLY SENSITIVE</h2>

<p>Painfully <a href="##" title="timida">shy</a>, Emily was often completely <a href="##" title="incapace">unable</a> to speak if addressed in public. After she completed her schooling, she tried teaching in another town, but the job proved such a <a href="##" title="fatica">strain</a> and she was so <a href="##" title="nostalgica di casa">homesick</a> that she became ill. She spent the rest of her life at home, looking after the house, writing poetry and doing what she loved best: walking or <a href="##" title="vagare">rambling</a> on the <a href="##" title="brughiere">moors</a> near Haworth. 
<a href="##" title="malgrado">In spite of</a> her difficulties with people, Emily loved animals and had a huge <a href="##" title="mastino">mastiff</a> called Keeper that only she could control. According to her biographer, Elizabeth Gaskell, she was once bitten by a <a href="##" title="cane rabbioso">rabid dog</a>. Not wanting to worry her family, she cauterised the <a href="##" title="ferita">wound</a> by burning her own flesh with a <a href="##" title="attizzatoio rovente">red hot poker</a> from the fire.</p>

<p>To keep the family together at home, Emily’s sister Charlotte planned to open a girls’ school in Haworth and, in 1842, the two sisters went to Brussels to perfect their language skills and learn school management at the Pension Héger. Although Emily was again <a href="##" title="nostalgica di casa">homesick</a> for her beloved <a href="##" title="brughiere">moors</a>, their teacher, Monsieur Héger, wrote appreciatively of her “powerful reason” and “strong <a href="##" title="perentoria">imperious</a> <a href="##" title="volontà">will</a>.” Emily was also an excellent piano player, so good in fact that Madame Héger offered her the position of music teacher at the school. However, after the death of her aunt, who was also her father’s <a href="##" title="governante">housekeeper</a>, Emily returned to Haworth.</p>

<h2 id="tragic-end">TRAGIC END</h2>

<p><a href="##" title="&quot;Cime tempestose&quot;">Wuthering Heights</a> is the only novel Emily wrote, although at the time of her death she was almost certainly writing another book. A letter from her publisher, Thomas Newby, from 1848 mentions the work and advises her not to <a href="##" title="affrettare">rush</a> its completion. Emily died of tuberculosis on 19 December 1848. Some <a href="##" title="testimonianze">accounts</a> suggest that before her death Emily burned her second book, knowing she would not live long enough to complete it. Others suggest that Charlotte destroyed it to save her sister’s reputation.
