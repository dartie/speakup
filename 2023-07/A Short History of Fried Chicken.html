<p>Many countries have their own fried chicken <a href="##" title="ricette">recipes</a>: the Japanese have Tatsuta-age, the Senegalese chicken yassa, the Italians pollo fritto, and the Austrians Weiner Backhendl. The most famous fried chicken in the world, <a href="##" title="tuttavia">however</a>, is American-style and associated with the Southern United States. This delicious, <a href="##" title="croccante">crispy</a> and <a href="##" title="economico">affordable</a> dish is now so popular globally that three of the five <a href="##" title="in crescita più rapida">fastest-growing</a> restaurant <a href="##" title="franchising, catene di ristoranti">franchises</a> in the world are fried chicken <a href="##" title="catene">chains</a>. So, who do we have to thank for the lucrative recipe?</p>

<h2 id="deep-frying-tradition">DEEP-FRYING TRADITION</h2>

<p>American-style fried chicken was perfected and popularised by <a href="##" title="schiavi">slaves</a> who worked in American kitchens from the 17th to the 19th century. Some food historians have <a href="##" title="rintracciare">traced</a> its <a href="##" title="radici">roots</a> back to their origin in West Africa, where it was a traditional dish. Other experts believe that the recipe <a href="##" title="potrebbe aver viaggiato">might have travelled</a> to America with Scottish <a href="##" title="coloni">settlers</a>, who would have taken their love for <a href="##" title="friggere in olio abbondante">deep-fried</a> food with them. Later, <a href="##" title="schiavi">slaves</a> started to cook fried chicken according to the recipe of their Scottish <a href="##" title="schiavisti">slaveholders</a>, <a href="##" title="migliorare">improving</a> it and making it part of their own culinary culture. </p>

<h2 id="an-entrepreneurial-success">AN ENTREPrENEURIAL SUCCESS</h2>

<p>By the time the American Civil War <a href="##" title="scoppiare">broke out</a> in 1861, fried chicken was a popular dish all over the South, and was eaten in both black and white American <a href="##" title="famiglie">households</a>. It was a lot of work to prepare, <a href="##" title="però, comunque">though</a>, so it was reserved for special occasions, such as Sunday lunch <a href="##" title="subito dopo">straight after</a> church. Many <a href="##" title="schiavi">slaves</a> had been <a href="##" title="permettere">allowed</a> <a href="##" title="allevare">to raise</a> chickens, and after emancipation, fried chicken became a <a href="##" title="mezzo, possibilità">means</a> of <a href="##" title="guadagno">income</a> for them. The town of Gordonsville, Virginia became known as the Fried Chicken Capital of the World, as black entrepreneurs started selling fried chicken at the train station to hungry passengers. This way, the <a href="##" title="semplice, modesto">humble</a> business of fried chicken helped many <a href="##" title="avere difficoltà">struggling</a> people <a href="##" title="mantenere">support</a> their families.</p>

<h2 id="the-modern-fried-chicken">THE MODERN FRIED CHICKEN</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="##" title="anche se prevedibile">if predictably</a>, the first American book that included a fried chicken recipe was written by a white woman, Mary Randolph; and the franchise that made the fried chicken business <a href="##" title="prendere il volo">take flight</a> was founded by a white man. In the 1950s, a businessman from Indiana called Colonel Harland David Sanders <a href="##" title="sviluppare">developed</a> his own secret fried chicken recipe, and patented a method of frying chicken in a <a href="##" title="friggitrice a pressione">pressure fryer</a>. By the 1970s, Kentucky Fried Chicken was a big name all over America. Even today, US Southerners are still the most enthusiastic fried chicken <a href="##" title="ambasciatori">ambassadors</a>, <a href="##" title="diffondere">spreading</a> their love of the dish across the world.
