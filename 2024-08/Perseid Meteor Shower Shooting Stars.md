# Perseid Meteor Shower: Shooting Stars   [B2]

A metà agosto di ogni anno, la Terra attraversa la scia della cometa Swift-Tuttle e migliaia di frammenti di roccia e ghiaccio entrano nell’atmosfera, provocando un sorprendente spettacolo di stelle cadenti.

Dreamers and amateur astrologists should look to the night sky in mid August. The Perseid [meteor shower](## "sciame meteorico") will [light up](## "illuminare") the heavens, in a [dazzling](## "abbagliante") display of [shooting stars](## "stelle cadenti"). They are visible for several weeks, but they will be brightest on certain nights. With the [moon setting](## "tramontare della luna") around midnight, the sky will be dark enough for viewing. The [pre-dawn](## "prima dell’alba") hours offer the best conditions to watch the show — and perhaps to make a wish.

## ROCKS AND ICE
So what is a meteor, exactly? It is not actually a star, but rather a piece of space [debris](## "detriti") falling down to Earth. It comes from the [rubble](## "macerie")[trailing](## "strascicare") behind a comet, consisting of rocks and ice. While in space, it is called a ‘meteoroid’ and, once on the ground, it is called a ‘meteorite’ but, while it travels through our skies, it is a [plain old meteor](## "meteora ordinaria"). When the Earth passes through a comet’s trail, these particles enter the atmosphere, where they burn up and display [streaks](## "strisce") of light. 

## ELUSIVE COMET
The Perseid meteors come from the Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which is in a 122-year orbit around the Sun. The comet itself was last seen in 1992 and will not be seen again until 2125, but its long trail of [debris](## "detriti") produces a [meteor shower](## "sciame meteorico") every year. Its next pass in a hundred years’ time is predicted to be as bright as Comet Halle-Bob in 1997, which was the brightest in recorded history.

## WHAT’S IN A NAME?
Swift-Tuttle is a very large comet. At 26km in diameter, it is twice the size of the one that supposedly killed the dinosaurs. The comet was named after two scientists — Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle — who separately discovered the comet in 1862. The meteors’ name derives from the constellation Perseus, after the [eponymous](## "eponimo") hero from Greek mythology. Perseus lies in the northern sky, in the shape of a [sideways Y](## "i greca di lato"). Every year, it provides the [backdrop](## "sfondo, scenario") of the Perseid shower.

## WHEN AND WHERE
This year promises to be quite spectacular, with up to a hundred meteors per hour visible during the peak. According to NASA, they will travel at 59 kilometres per second, reaching temperatures of 1,650° C. The Perseids are best seen in areas with minimal light pollution, so the countryside or a park are ideal. [Stargazing](## "osservazione delle stelle") apps will help to locate the right place to look. [Avoid](## "evitare") looking at your phone and allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness. Then [lie on your back](## "sdraiarsi sulla schiena"), watch the show and, [if you are so inclined](## "se sei propenso"), [wish upon a star](## "esprimere un desiderio").
