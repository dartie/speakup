# Duh! All Too Obvious   [A2]

Si tratta di un’espressione che calza a pennello quando commettiamo un errore così clamoroso da desiderare che la terra ci inghiotta, o quando siamo sopraffatti dalla vergogna per un errore.

Duh!’ is an expression used to indicate that something is [self-evident](## "evidente, ovvio") or too obvious. This short, funny word, pronounced more or less ‘da’ (/dʌ/), is often used jokingly in a [slightly](## "leggermente")[mocking](## "derisorio, beffardo") tone and adds a touch of humour to conversations. However, it isn’t really a [slang](## "gergo") word, [but rather](## "ma piuttosto") a sarcastic alternative to ‘obviously’, ‘of course’, ‘no kidding’ or ‘that’s so obvious!’ It is used to indicate that something is [exceedingly apparent](## "estremamente evidente"), very clear and easy to understand, or to express [annoyance](## "fastidio") at banality, stupidity or obviousness.
In fact, a lot of people use ‘duh’ for themselves more than they use it for others when they realise that they have said or done something [dumb](## "stupido"). For example, you are standing in front of a door and try [to push it open](## "spingere per aprire"). Then, right in front of you, you read a big sign that says “Pull”. You pull the door open and say to yourself “Oh, duh!”.  

## ORIGINS
The origin of the word ‘duh’ is unclear. It appeared in a 1943 Warner Brothers cartoon starring Bugs Bunny, which may have helped popularise it in the US. The expression is now quite common among young people and famously [features](## "essere presente") repeatedly in one of Billie Eilish’s most successful songs, Bad Guy.

## WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE
‘Duh’ is generally used with humorous intent, but sometimes with the purpose of [mocking](## "derisorio, beffardo") oneself or another person. [It can be [mean](## "meschino")t](## "può essere inteso") to call someone stupid in either a [mean](## "meschino") or a funny way. So, be careful when using ‘duh’ because, even if it’s a [mild](## "tenue") word, it can sometimes sound [rude](## "scortese"). That’s why it’s best to use ‘duh’ with friends or people you know well, since in formal situations or with strangers it might be considered disrespectful. Definitely not to be used in a professional context!   
**‘DUH’, ‘DOH’ AND ‘NO DUH’**
At times ‘duh!’ is replaced by the alternative ‘no duh!’, especially in spoken English. It [mean](## "meschino")s exactly the same thing and is used in the same way. Which is surprising, since even if you put ‘no’ in front of ‘duh’, the [mean](## "meschino")ing is basically the same: a sarcastic ‘obviously’.
In the last few decades, the usage of ‘duh’ has in some cases been replaced by ‘doh!’ (often spelled ‘d’oh’), popularised by Homer Simpson, with a [slightly](## "leggermente") different [mean](## "meschino")ing. Homer’s iconic [catchphrase](## "motto") is rather used as an expression of frustration referred to the speaker himself and is more like a word such as ‘[dammit](## "maledizione! (abb. damn it)")’ or a [self-deprecatory](## "autoironica") exclamation like ‘I feel stupid that I didn’t see that coming’.
