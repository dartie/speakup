<p>Their real name is After Eight Dark Chocolate Mint <a href="##" title="sottile">Thins</a>, but everyone knows them simply as ‘After Eights’. If you are a fan of mint chocolate you have <a href="##" title="sicuramente, senza dubbio">no doubt</a> <a href="##" title="assaggiare, provare">tried</a> them. They are sold in more than fifty countries, but the UK is where they are most popular. So, what is the story behind After Eights? And how were they first made? As it <a href="##" title="risultare">to turn out</a>, the answer to the second question <a href="##" title="restare">remains</a> a <a href="##" title="custodito">tightly-guarded</a> secret!

<strong>A TASTY TECHNICAL TRIUMPH</strong>
After Eights were invented <a href="##" title="nei primi anni ‘60">in the early 1960s</a> by Brian Sollitt, a <a href="##" title="pasticciere">confectioner</a> at Rowntree Company Limited in York. He had started working there as an apprentice when he was fifteen, inspired — after a <a href="##" title="infanzia">childhood</a> of <a href="##" title="tempo di guerra">wartime</a> rationing — to create a <a href="##" title="dolcetto, delizia">treat</a> both stylish and accessibly priced. In his twenties, he made a delicate peppermint fondant and covered it with a thin <a href="##" title="strato">layer</a> of dark chocolate. This was <a href="##" title="un bel risultato">quite an achievement</a> from a technical point of view; in fact, the secret to prevent the liquid fondant from <a href="##" title="fuoriuscire">oozing out</a> has never been <a href="##" title="rivelare">disclosed</a>.
<strong>AFFORDABLE LUXURY</strong>
Before the 1960s, chocolate products were seen as luxurious because they needed <a href="##" title="mantenere refrigerati">to be kept cool</a>, especially during summer. The presence of refrigerators in <a href="##" title="quasi">nearly</a> every home meant that chocolate was now <a href="##" title="alla portata di tutti">within everyone’s reach</a>, but it still retained a certain prestige. At a time when the middle classes aspired to a more stylish way of life, After Eight mints became an economical way to acquire it. After-dinner mints had become a <a href="##" title="segno distintivo">hallmark</a> of dinner parties and Sollitt’s creation became a firm favourite. The elegant modern packaging was a marketing success and helped consolidate their popularity.
<strong>A CHOCOLATIER’S DREAM</strong>
Over time, After Eights lost their classy image and became a <a href="##" title="piuttosto">rather</a> old-fashioned <a href="##" title="dolcetto, delizia">treat</a> — although one that is still a best-seller. The original recipe was <a href="##" title="senza lattosio">dairy-free</a>, but after Nestlé bought the <a href="##" title="marca">brand</a>, <a href="##" title="materia grassa del latte">butterfat</a> was <a href="##" title="aggiungere">added</a> to the mixture.
Brian Sollitt became one of the world’s biggest <a href="##" title="collezionisti">collectors</a> of After Eight memorabilia, and he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his chocolate mints in 2012 by making a three-kilogram After Eight! He presented it to the British Parliament, and later said that it was the proudest moment of his life.</p>
