# The Police’s Every Breath  You Take   [B1]

Il grande successo che rese popolare questo trio e fece di Sting una star viene considerato tuttora come una canzone d’amore. Invece il testo era stato concepito da una prospettiva inquietante.

The most frequently played track in radio history, Every Breath You Take is a [twisted](## "contorta, perversa") love song by English rock band The Police. The best-selling single of 1983, it spent eight weeks at the top of the US [charts](## "classifiche"), and [featured](## "far parte") on the band’s final album “Synchronicity”. It was written by [Sting](## "pungiglione") (whose real name is Gordon Sumner) during a [messy](## "caotico, difficile") divorce from his first wife, Frances Tomelty. The musician was on a break in Jamaica and staying at GoldenEye, the villa once owned by James Bond creator Ian Fleming. As he told The Independent “I woke up in the middle of the night with that [line](## "frase") in my head, and sat down at the piano and had written it in half an hour”. Guitarist Andy Summers added the famous guitar riff in one [take](## "registrazione") when The Police recorded the song a few months later.
Many mis[take](## "registrazione")nly interpret the song as romantic, but it is in fact a sinister message from a [stalker](## "molestatore, maniaco") to his victim. [Sting](## "pungiglione") said he was inspired by George Orwell’s novel 1984: “I was thinking of Big Brother, of surveillance and control” and the song is about “jealousy and [ownership](## "proprietà")”.
Lyrically the song is simple and repetitive, using common collocations with verbs using the same [[vow](## "vow")el](## "vocale") sound ‘ei’. Police [drummer](## "batterista") Stewart Copeland criticised the track for having “an [utter lack](## "totale mancanza") of [groove](## "ritmo")”. He believed that while it was “[Sting](## "pungiglione")’s best song” it had “the worst [arrangement](## "arrangiamento")”.
The song won two Grammy Awards, and then found a whole new audience when it was sampled in Puff Daddy’s I’ll Be Missing You, a 1997 tribute to the murdered recording artist The Notorious B.I.G., featuring vocals by his [widow](## "vedova") Faith Evans. [Sting](## "pungiglione") later performed the song [a[long](## "desiderare, bramare")side](## "insieme a") Puff Daddy and Evans at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards.
Every breath you [take](## "registrazione")
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you [take](## "registrazione")
I’ll be watching you
 
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I’ll be watching you
Oh, can’t you see
You be[long](## "desiderare, bramare") to me?
How my poor heart [aches](## "dolere, fare male")
With every step you [take](## "registrazione")?
 
Every move you make
And every [vow](## "vow") you break
Every smile you [fake](## "fingere")
Every claim you s[take](## "registrazione")
I’ll be watching you
Since you’ve gone,
I’ve been lost [without a trace](## "senza lasciare traccia")
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it’s you I can’t [replace](## "sostituire")
I feel so cold, and I [long](## "desiderare, bramare") for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby please
 
Oh, can’t you see
You be[long](## "desiderare, bramare") to me?
How my poor heart [aches](## "dolere, fare male")
With every step you [take](## "registrazione")?
Every move you make
And every [vow](## "vow") you break
Every smile you [fake](## "fingere")
Every claim you s[take](## "registrazione")
I’ll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you [take](## "registrazione")
I’ll be watching you
 
I’ll be watching you
(Every breath you [take](## "registrazione"))
(Every move you make)
(Every bond you break)
(Every step you [take](## "registrazione")) I’ll be watching you
I’ll be watching you
I’ll be watching you
whoo, hoo
