<p>Durante i miei anni da studente, ho lavorato come assistente domiciliare per gli anziani e ho conosciuto la signora B, una celebrità locale con storie affascinanti. Un misterioso regalo lasciatomi dopo la sua dipartita ha svelato i segreti della sua vita e ha lasciato un&rsquo;impronta indelebile anche nella mia.</p>

<p>When I was a student, I had a summer job as a home help for the <a href="##" title="anziani">elderly</a>. It was nothing medical; I just provided a bit of <a href="##" title="allegra">cheerful</a> conversation to keep them company. They loved to talk and I learned a lot of local history. Sometimes I made notes. It was my dream to write a novel one day, and I thought that all these anecdotes might provide useful material.
I heard the best stories from Mrs. B. The widow of a magistrate, she had done a lot of charitable work. In fact, she was considered a local celebrity and I was quite nervous the first time I walked up the <a href="##" title="entrata">drive</a> of her large old house. Her son, Hector, opened the door. Tall and <a href="##" title="rimanendo calvo">balding</a>, with long melancholic <a href="##" title="tratti">features</a>, he <a href="##" title="stringere la mano"><a href="##" title="scuotere">shook</a> my hand</a> and <a href="##" title="condurre">led</a> me to his mother’s room.
“There won’t be much for you to do,’ he said. ‘Mother is quite near the end. You can read her some poems. My <a href="##" title="defunto">late</a> father was a published poet, you know.’
Mrs. B was <a href="##" title="profondamente addormentata">fast asleep</a>. She was a <a href="##" title="minuscola">tiny</a> creature, an <a href="##" title="assortimento">assortment</a> of bones loosely held together by a membrane of transparent skin. I’d never seen anyone alive look so skeletal.
“Shall I read to her, then?”
Hector <a href="##" title="assentire">nodded</a> and indicated an old book with a <a href="##" title="consunta">well-worn</a> cover on the bedside table. “My father’s first published collection.”
Feeling <a href="##" title="in imbarazzo">self-conscious</a>, I began to read aloud. It was heavy, sombre stuff. Hector silently left the room; seconds <a href="##" title="defunto">late</a>r I saw him walking down the <a href="##" title="entrata">drive</a>.
“Has he gone?”
I <a href="##" title="girarsi">spun round</a>, and the book fell to the floor. Mrs. B was  <a href="##" title="scrutare">peering</a> at me with bright, bird-like eyes.
“Yes, he has.”
“Thank the Lord. You haven’t got a cigarette, have you?”
Her voice sounded <a href="##" title="spessa">thick</a> in her <a href="##" title="senza denti">toothless</a> mouth. When I realised what she wanted, I <a href="##" title="scuotere">shook</a> my head <a href="##" title="senza dire nulla">wordlessly</a>. She rol<a href="##" title="condurre">led</a> her eyes and ordered me to help her <a href="##" title="sedersi">sit up</a>; she was light as a child.
“Pass my teeth, will you?” She pointed to a glass containing her dentures. I <a href="##" title="passare">handed</a> it to her then <a href="##" title="chinarsi">bent down</a> to <a href="##" title="prendere, raccogliere">retrieve</a> the book of poems.
“Leave it there, dear. It’s <a href="##" title="spazzatura tremenda">appalling rubbish</a>.” Her voice was much clearer with her teeth in. “What’s your name?”
I introduced myself and explained that I was from the agency.
“Very good,” she said. “Now <a href="##" title="portare">fetch</a> me the wooden box in the bottom of that <a href="##" title="cassetto">drawer</a> over there.”
The first box I found was quite large. It was antique and made beautifully-<a href="##" title="intarsiato">inlaid</a> wood.
“Is it this one? I think it’s <a href="##" title="chiusa a chiave">locked</a>.”
“No, not that one,” she said <a href="##" title="bruscamente">sharply</a>.” That one’s got my diaries in it. You hadn’t better read those!” She <a href="##" title="ridacchiare">gigg<a href="##" title="condurre">led</a></a> girlishly. “Look <a href="##" title="più in fondo">further back</a>.”
A smaller box was hidden under some clothes. It contained a packet of cigarettes and a lighter.
“The cleaner keeps me <a href="##" title="fornire">supplied</a>,” she <a href="##" title="confidare">confided</a>. “Open the window, will you? If Hector smells smoke, he’ll <a href="##" title="dar la colpa, accusare">blame</a> you! Now, shall we watch Love Island?”
I enjoyed my chats with Mrs. B and I think she liked to shock me. Married to Hector’s father for forty years, she had travel<a href="##" title="condurre">led</a> all over the world, enjoying tempestuous love affairs <a href="##" title="lungo il percorso">along the way</a>. And she remembered them all!
She loved to <a href="##" title="ricordare">reminisce</a> about André, Paris 1948, Harvey, New York 1956 and Christos, summer in Crete, 1969, to mention just a few. Every time I <a href="##" title="rimettere a posto">replaced</a> the box with cigarettes in the bottom <a href="##" title="cassetto">drawer</a> and caught sight of the larger <a href="##" title="intarsiato">inlaid</a> box, I <a href="##" title="bramare, anelare">yearned</a> to know what was in Mrs. B’s diaries. Here <a href="##" title="davvero">indeed</a> was material for a novel. 
Mrs. B <a href="##" title="sbuffare">snorted</a> with <a href="##" title="risata">laughter</a> when I told her I wanted to be a novelist and I think she <a href="##" title="immaginarsi, indovinare">guessed</a> why I encouraged her to talk about her past. She had a bird-like way of putting her head on one side, her eyes <a href="##" title="brillare, scintillare">twinkling</a>. On one of my last visits, she pressed a small <a href="##" title="chiave di ottone">brass key</a> into my hand. “Keep that safe,” she <a href="##" title="sussurrare">whispered</a>, a conspiratorial <a href="##" title="bagliore, luce">gleam</a> in her eye. “It’s my little gift to you; something to remember me by.” I <a href="##" title="immaginarsi, indovinare">guessed</a> what the key was for and the idea fil<a href="##" title="condurre">led</a> me with anticipation.
After I returned to university that autumn, I received the sad news that Mrs. B had <a href="##" title="morire">passed away</a>. My mother sent me a link to an article in the local newspaper. The headline read: “Local Benefactress Dies”.
When I went home for Christmas, the agency cal<a href="##" title="condurre">led</a> me in and <a href="##" title="passare">handed</a> me a package, which they said had been left to me by Mrs. B. I <a href="##" title="affrettarsi">rushed</a> home to open it and, sure enough, inside was the antique <a href="##" title="intarsiato">inlaid</a> box. The small <a href="##" title="chiave di ottone">brass key</a> she had given me <a href="##" title="entrare, essere adatta">fitted</a> the lock perfectly. I opened the box slowly, savouring the moment. Now I would learn all about Mrs. B’s fascinating life.
A single book with a <a href="##" title="consunta">well-worn</a> cover <a href="##" title="giacere">lay</a> at the bottom. It was her husband’s first collection of poems. The old girl had <a href="##" title="imbrogliare">tricked</a> me. At first I was <a href="##" title="amaramente">bitterly</a> disappointed, but then I smi<a href="##" title="condurre">led</a>, thinking of her girlish laugh. Who was I to be the custodian of her deepest secrets? One thing was certain: I would never forget her.
