# A short story: The Secrets of Mrs. B   [C1]

Durante i miei anni da studente, ho lavorato come assistente domiciliare per gli anziani e ho conosciuto la signora B, una celebrità locale con storie affascinanti. Un misterioso regalo lasciatomi dopo la sua dipartita ha svelato i segreti della sua vita e ha lasciato un'impronta indelebile anche nella mia.

When I was a student, I had a summer job as a home help for the [elderly](## "anziani"). It was nothing medical; I just provided a bit of [cheerful](## "allegra") conversation to keep them company. They loved to talk and I learned a lot of local history. Sometimes I made notes. It was my dream to write a novel one day, and I thought that all these anecdotes might provide useful material.
I heard the best stories from Mrs. B. The widow of a magistrate, she had done a lot of charitable work. In fact, she was considered a local celebrity and I was quite nervous the first time I walked up the [drive](## "entrata") of her large old house. Her son, Hector, opened the door. Tall and [balding](## "rimanendo calvo"), with long melancholic [features](## "tratti"), he [[shook](## "scuotere") my hand](## "stringere la mano") and [led](## "condurre") me to his mother’s room.
“There won’t be much for you to do,’ he said. ‘Mother is quite near the end. You can read her some poems. My [late](## "defunto") father was a published poet, you know.’
Mrs. B was [fast asleep](## "profondamente addormentata"). She was a [tiny](## "minuscola") creature, an [assortment](## "assortimento") of bones loosely held together by a membrane of transparent skin. I’d never seen anyone alive look so skeletal.
“Shall I read to her, then?”
Hector [nodded](## "assentire") and indicated an old book with a [well-worn](## "consunta") cover on the bedside table. “My father’s first published collection.”
Feeling [self-conscious](## "in imbarazzo"), I began to read aloud. It was heavy, sombre stuff. Hector silently left the room; seconds [late](## "defunto")r I saw him walking down the [drive](## "entrata").
“Has he gone?”
I [spun round](## "girarsi"), and the book fell to the floor. Mrs. B was  [peering](## "scrutare") at me with bright, bird-like eyes.
“Yes, he has.”
“Thank the Lord. You haven’t got a cigarette, have you?”
Her voice sounded [thick](## "spessa") in her [toothless](## "senza denti") mouth. When I realised what she wanted, I [shook](## "scuotere") my head [wordlessly](## "senza dire nulla"). She rol[led](## "condurre") her eyes and ordered me to help her [sit up](## "sedersi"); she was light as a child.
“Pass my teeth, will you?” She pointed to a glass containing her dentures. I [handed](## "passare") it to her then [bent down](## "chinarsi") to [retrieve](## "prendere, raccogliere") the book of poems.
“Leave it there, dear. It’s [appalling rubbish](## "spazzatura tremenda").” Her voice was much clearer with her teeth in. “What’s your name?”
I introduced myself and explained that I was from the agency.
“Very good,” she said. “Now [fetch](## "portare") me the wooden box in the bottom of that [drawer](## "cassetto") over there.”
The first box I found was quite large. It was antique and made beautifully-[inlaid](## "intarsiato") wood.
“Is it this one? I think it’s [locked](## "chiusa a chiave").”
“No, not that one,” she said [sharply](## "bruscamente").” That one’s got my diaries in it. You hadn’t better read those!” She [gigg[led](## "condurre")](## "ridacchiare") girlishly. “Look [further back](## "più in fondo").”
A smaller box was hidden under some clothes. It contained a packet of cigarettes and a lighter.
“The cleaner keeps me [supplied](## "fornire"),” she [confided](## "confidare"). “Open the window, will you? If Hector smells smoke, he’ll [blame](## "dar la colpa, accusare") you! Now, shall we watch Love Island?”
I enjoyed my chats with Mrs. B and I think she liked to shock me. Married to Hector’s father for forty years, she had travel[led](## "condurre") all over the world, enjoying tempestuous love affairs [along the way](## "lungo il percorso"). And she remembered them all!
She loved to [reminisce](## "ricordare") about André, Paris 1948, Harvey, New York 1956 and Christos, summer in Crete, 1969, to mention just a few. Every time I [replaced](## "rimettere a posto") the box with cigarettes in the bottom [drawer](## "cassetto") and caught sight of the larger [inlaid](## "intarsiato") box, I [yearned](## "bramare, anelare") to know what was in Mrs. B’s diaries. Here [indeed](## "davvero") was material for a novel. 
Mrs. B [snorted](## "sbuffare") with [laughter](## "risata") when I told her I wanted to be a novelist and I think she [guessed](## "immaginarsi, indovinare") why I encouraged her to talk about her past. She had a bird-like way of putting her head on one side, her eyes [twinkling](## "brillare, scintillare"). On one of my last visits, she pressed a small [brass key](## "chiave di ottone") into my hand. “Keep that safe,” she [whispered](## "sussurrare"), a conspiratorial [gleam](## "bagliore, luce") in her eye. “It’s my little gift to you; something to remember me by.” I [guessed](## "immaginarsi, indovinare") what the key was for and the idea fil[led](## "condurre") me with anticipation.
After I returned to university that autumn, I received the sad news that Mrs. B had [passed away](## "morire"). My mother sent me a link to an article in the local newspaper. The headline read: “Local Benefactress Dies”.
When I went home for Christmas, the agency cal[led](## "condurre") me in and [handed](## "passare") me a package, which they said had been left to me by Mrs. B. I [rushed](## "affrettarsi") home to open it and, sure enough, inside was the antique [inlaid](## "intarsiato") box. The small [brass key](## "chiave di ottone") she had given me [fitted](## "entrare, essere adatta") the lock perfectly. I opened the box slowly, savouring the moment. Now I would learn all about Mrs. B’s fascinating life.
A single book with a [well-worn](## "consunta") cover [lay](## "giacere") at the bottom. It was her husband’s first collection of poems. The old girl had [tricked](## "imbrogliare") me. At first I was [bitterly](## "amaramente") disappointed, but then I smi[led](## "condurre"), thinking of her girlish laugh. Who was I to be the custodian of her deepest secrets? One thing was certain: I would never forget her.
