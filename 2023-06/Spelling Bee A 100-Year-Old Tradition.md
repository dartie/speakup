# Spelling Bee: A 100-Year-Old Tradition   [A2]

Quando non esistevano i correttori ortografici digitali la gente doveva basarsi sulla propria memoria per scrivere correttamente i vocaboli. Adesso gli alunni delle scuole degli Stati Uniti vengono incoraggiati con grossi premi a competere nelle ‘spelling bees’.

 A [spelling](## "fare lo spelling, compitare") bee is a difficult [spelling](## "fare lo spelling, compitare") competition in which participants of school age have to spell a series of words, letter by letter. If a contestant [misspells](## "sbagliare l’ortografia") a word, they are immediately eliminated. Spelling bees originated in the United States around a hundred years ago and today take place in almost all elementary and middle schools in the country. While classroom and school [spelling](## "fare lo spelling, compitare") bees take place regularly, there are also local and state competitions. The best spellers compete at national level at a [high-profile](## "di grande risonanza") annual event called the Scripps National Spelling Bee. The final round is [broadcast](## "emettere") live, and the [overall](## "assoluto") winner [awarded](## "premiare") $52,500 in [cash](## "cash") plus $400 [worth](## "dal valore di 400 dollari") of the Encyclopedia Britannica.
**WHAT'S IN ITS NAME? **
The word ‘bee’ is not a reference to [buzzing](## "ronzare") insect, but derived from an Old English word meaning a [‘prayer‘](## "preghiera")‘ or a favour. By the 18th century, it had come to describe any [gathering](## "riunione") of people who unite their [efforts](## "sforzi") to [accomplish a task](## "realizzare un compito"). ‘Bee’ is usually preceded by another word that defines their [purpose](## "scopo"): for example, an ‘apple bee’ is when farmers get together to [harvest](## "raccogliere") apples, or a ‘[quilt](## "coperta")ing bee’ is when a group of people gather to make a [quilt](## "coperta"). The expression ‘[spelling](## "fare lo spelling, compitare") bee’ means a group of people who [assemble](## "riunirsi") to spell words — [albeit](## "sebbene") in competition with each other.
**ENGLISH SPELLING**
Spelling English words can be [tricky](## "complicato"), even for native speakers. There are forty-four sounds or ‘phonemes’ in the English language, but only twenty-six letters in its alphabet. English [borrows](## "prendere in prestito") many words from other languages, and has [developed](## "sviluppare") in a number of different countries around the world at different periods of time. As a result, the relationship between some words’ [spelling](## "fare lo spelling, compitare") and their pronunciation can be unpredictable. Perhaps given the country’s history as a [melting pot](## "crogiuolo, miscuglio")  [fusing](## "fondere") many nationalities, [spelling](## "fare lo spelling, compitare") bees are extremely popular in the US.
**THE FIRST COMPETITION**
The National Spelling Bee was celebrated in 1925 as a consolidation of numerous local [spelling](## "fare lo spelling, compitare") bees. It was organised by a [newspaper](## "giornale") called the Courier-Journal based in Louisville, Kentucky. The winner was eleven-year-old Frank Neuhauser who, with his correct [spelling](## "fare lo spelling, compitare") of the final word ‘gladiolus’ (a kind of plant), won $500 in gold, a bicycle and a trip to the White House to meet US President Calvin Coolidge.
**WINNING WORDS**
Some of the [toughest](## "più difficili") winning words correctly spelt in Scripps National Spelling Bees in the past are: “albumen” (another word for [egg whites](## "albumi")); “chiaroscurist” (a painter who uses light and [shade](## "ombra") [rather than](## "anziché") colour to create the illusion of volume); “autochthonous” (referring to a person indigenous to a place); “staphylococci” (a bacterium that causes pus to form); and “foulard” (a [lightweight](## "leggerissimo") [fabric](## "tessuto") made of [silk](## "seta") or a mix of [silk](## "seta") and [cotton](## "cotone")).
