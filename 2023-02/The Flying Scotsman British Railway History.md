# The Flying Scotsman: British Railway History   [B2]

Nel secolo scorso un’emblematica locomotiva a vapore collegava Londra con Edimburgo a una velocità da
record. Il Museo Nazionale Ferroviario organizza un’esposizione in occasione del centenario del Flying
Scotsman, onorando così i decenni di servizio che ha regalato ai suoi passeggeri.

A century ago, on 24 February 1923, a new [steam locomotive](## "locomotiva a vapore") was [unveiled](## "presentare") that changed British railway history. The Flying Scotsman, so called after the [daily](## "giornaliero") 10am London to Edinburgh rail service which began in 1862, was designed by railway engineer Sir Nigel Gresley, and built in Doncaster in Yorkshire.  By 1928, the train was travelling non-stop, completing the 534-kilometre route in just eight hours. The following year, it was the star of British cinema’s first [talkie](## "film sonoro"), a dramatic love story in which a [fireman](## "vigile del fuoco") saves the train from a malicious [attempt](## "tentativo") at [wrecking](## "distruggere") it.

## speed and style
In 1934, the Flying Scotsman became the first locomotive in the UK to [reach](## "raggiungere") 100mph (160.93 kmph). During the pre-war years, the locomotive [matched](## "abbinare") speed with style, with innovations such as a cinema car, cocktail bar and even a [hairdressing salon](## "parrucchiere"). During the war, it was painted black, [in common with](## "così come") all wartime [railway stock](## "materiale ferroviario"). But it returned to its [signature](## "caratteristico") dark green in the post-war period.

## AROUND THE WORLD
In 1963, the [age](## "era") of steam was [coming to an end](## "giungere al termine"), and the Flying Scotsman was retired from service. In 1969, it [ended up](## "finire") [stranded](## "abbandonato") in the US; its new [owner](## "proprietario"), the British railway enthusiast Alan Pegler, had [attempt](## "tentativo")ed [to tour](## "portare in tournée") the train but had [run out](## "rimanere senza") of money. The Flying Scotsman was rescued and [restored](## "restaurare") in 1973 by businessman William Alpine. Sir William kept it running for twenty-three years, during which time it became the first [steam locomotive](## "locomotiva a vapore") to travel all around the globe. 

## NATIONAL TREASURE
When the Flying Scotsman once again changed hands, a campaign led by the National Railway Museum to save the train [amassed](## "riunire, accumulare") significant public support. With the help of a [grant](## "sovvenzione") and a £365,000 donation from entrepreneur Richard Branson, the well-loved locomotive was [restored](## "restaurare") at a cost of £4.2million. 
The Flying Scotsman was presented to enthusiastic crowds in 2016, having been [fitted](## "integrare, dotare di") with a whole new [range](## "gamma") of components and [parts](## "pezzi"), along with [enhancements](## "migliorie") to allow it to operate in the 21st century. It now spends part of its time in the National Railway Museum in York as a working museum exhibit, and the rest of the time as the oldest [mainline](## "linea principale") working locomotive on Britain’s [tracks](## "binari").
