**Mary:** Good morning, neighbour! Lovely day, isn’t it?
**Nick:**  Yes, we’re due a bit of [sunshine](## "luce del sole") after all that rain. It was rough last night, wasn’t it?
**Mary:** Yes, that thunderstorm woke me up in a fright! It sounded like the world was ending.
**Nick:** That stormfront is all over Europe. My sister in Spain said they had spectacular [thunder and lightning](## "tuoni e fulmini") last night, too.
**Mary:** Well, I prefer dramatic weather to that dull drizzle that we’ve been having.
**Nick:** Grey skies and drizzle, that’s British weather for you!
**Mary:** I know. I’m [out for a jog](## "andare a correre") — got to make the most of it [while it lasts](## "finché dura")!
**Nick:** Good for you. It won’t, you know. There’s more rain predicted later today.
**Mary:** Oh, I hadn’t looked at the forecast yet. They [get it wrong](## "sbagliare") [more often than not](## "il più delle volte").
**Nick:** That’s true. I may meet my friends for a picnic before it gets overcast.
**Mary:** That’s it. Got to stay optimistic! Have a great day.
**Nick:** You, too!

## NOW  LET’S  REVIEW  THE  VOCABULARY!
**To be due** something means that it is time for it; it would be [fair](## "giusto") for it to happen.
**Rough** in this context means ‘[stormy](## "tempestoso")’.
A **thunderstorm** is a storm with [thunder and lightning](## "tuoni e fulmini"), often with heavy rain or [hail](## "grandine").
You can say **in a fright** to indicate a sudden feeling of fear.
An area of [stormy](## "tempestoso") weather is called a **stormfront.**
[Dull](## "grigio, coperto") weather is [cloudy](## "nuvoloso") and grey, A **drizzle** is [light rain](## "pioviggine") falling in very fine [drops](## "gocce"). A **dull drizzle** refers to [miserable](## "triste"), [damp](## "umido") weather.
Clouds make the sky look grey, so you talk of **grey skies**.
**That’s (something) for you!** is an ironic [statement](## "affermazione") to indicate a poor example of something, in this case, British weather!
**To make the most of something** means [to use something to the best advantage](## "usare al meglio").
