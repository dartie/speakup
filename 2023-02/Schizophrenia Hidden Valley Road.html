<p>Schizophrenia is one of the most mysterious and destructive of severe mental illnesses. A classification of symptoms <a href="##" title="invece di">rather than</a> a specific condition, sufferers may have hallucinations, <a href="##" title="deliri">delusions</a>, paranoia, catatonia and/or extremely disordered thinking and <a href="##" title="comportamento">behaviour</a>. The illness progresses with psychotic episodes or ‘breaks’ that <a href="##" title="danneggiare">damage</a> the brain, leading to more illness, <a href="##" title="lesioni">injuries</a>, legal and financial difficulties, and even death. Schizophrenia affects around 1 per cent of the population directly, and <a href="##" title="innumerevoli">countless</a> others indirectly. </p>

<h2 id="freud-vs-jung">freud vs. jung</h2>

<p>The word ‘schizophrenia’ was first used in 1911. At that time, Sigmund Freud, the Austrian founder of psychoanalysis, wrote a case study based on the diary of a German <a href="##" title="ex">former</a> judge called Daniel Schreber, who wrote about his experience of his own severe mental illness. Freud decided that Schreber suffered from an extreme form of neurosis and that his <a href="##" title="deliri">delusions</a> could be interpreted the same way that dreams could. Others, however, including Freud’s friend and disciple Carl Jung, strongly <a href="##" title="non essere d’accordo">disagreed</a>. Jung believed that there was something genetic or a physical defect in the brain that caused schizophrenia. That <a href="##" title="discussione">argument</a> between <a href="##" title="allevamento">nurture</a> (environmental factors) and nature (genetic factors) ended Freud and Jung’s professional relationship. It has had a major influence on the way the illness has been perceived, researched and treated <a href="##" title="da allora">ever since</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-galvins">the galvins</h2>

<p>Freud’s influence was at its <a href="##" title="cima">peak</a> in 1960s America, when Don and Mimi Galvin, an <a href="##" title="classe medio-alta">upper-middle class</a> Irish-Catholic couple were making their home in Colorado Springs in western US. Don worked as a teacher in a new Air Force academy, while Mimi <a href="##" title="crescere">brought up</a> their family of ten boys and two girls. But by the time the <a href="##" title="maggiore">eldest</a> son, Donald, had <a href="##" title="raggiungere">reached</a> his 20s, the Galvin’s perfect lives were beginning <a href="##" title="spezzarsi, distruggersi">to fall apart</a>. Donald’s <a href="##" title="comportamento">behaviour</a> had become too strange and <a href="##" title="minacciante">threatening</a> to ignore. With time, five of the other Galvin boys began <a href="##" title="manifestare">to display</a> the symptoms of schizophrenia. </p>

<h2 id="the-journalist">THE JOURNALIST</h2>

<p>The illness devastated the entire Galvin family. But the Galvins were also essential to understanding schizophrenia better. It was rare that so many <a href="##" title="fratelli (e sorelle)">siblings</a> suffer from the illness, and their genetic material proved vital for research. In 2017, the journalist Robert Kolker was asked by the youngest <a href="##" title="fratelli (e sorelle)">siblings</a>, Margaret and Mary, to write their family’s story. As he put together the book, reading extensively and s<a href="##" title="cima">peak</a>ing to family members, psychiatrists and geneticists about the illness, Kolker realised just how extraordinary the Galvins were.
