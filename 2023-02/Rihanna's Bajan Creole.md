Barbados was a British colony from 1625 until 1966. Until around 1800, [enslaved](## "schiavizzare") West Africans were taken there, and forced to work and learn English. Today, while English is s[till](## "fino a") the official language used for formal occasions in Barbados, a unique language called Bajan is [widely](## "ampiamente") spoken. 

## [creole](## "creolo")
The word ‘Bajan’ is a colloquial term for a Barbadian; that is, a person from Barbados. Bajan [creole](## "creolo") formed as different African languages mixed with simplified English. Its grammar is close to standard English, but there is no [set](## "stabilito") written form and [spellings](## "ortografia") can vary. Bajan developed as a way for African slaves to communicate. [Slave masters](## "schiavisti") couldn’t understand it, and it became a form of resistance connecting Barbadians to each other and their African [heritage](## "tradizione culturale").

## BAJAN HERO
Rihanna is one of the most-celebrated Barbadians in the world. While her Bajan accent is [mild](## "leggero"), many [features](## "caratteristiche") of the language are present in the way she talks. In 2021, Barbados honoured the singer as a national hero. In her speech, Rihanna uses Bajan terms such as ‘ya know?’ and ’y’all’ (all of you) as well as ‘gonna’ [to pay homage](## "rendere omaggio") to her people and their shared language and culture.
**Rihanna (Bajan accent): **I’m so proud to be a Bajan. I’m gonna be a Bajan [till](## "fino a") the day I die. This is s[till](## "fino a") the only place I’ve ever called home. I love Barbados, I love you guys and I pray that the youth continue [to push Barbados forward](## "far avanzare, dare impulso"). I’m so proud of you. [No matter](## "poco importa") if it’s the accent, the sunshine, the people, man, the people! Y’all are the true heroes of Barbados and I take y’all with me [wherever](## "ovunque") I go. 

## bajan [to the bone](## "fino in fondo (lett. ‘fino alle ossa’)")
Leaving the main verb out of a sentence or repeating words for emphasis are both Bajan [traits](## "peculiarità"). See if you can [spot](## "individuare") more ways Rihanna speaks Bajan:
**Rihanna:** Prime Minister Mia Mottley, thank you so much for honouring me in this way. I have travelled the world and received several awards and recognitions, but nothing, nothing compares to being recognised in the [soil](## "terra") that you grew in. This is a day that I will never ever forget. It’s also a day that I never [saw coming](## "prevedere"). Barbadians are proud people, you know? We are probably the proudest people I know, and no matter where I go in the world, I take that pride with me. [No matter](## "poco importa") where we go, the world is gonna know that we Bajan [to the bone](## "fino in fondo (lett. ‘fino alle ossa’)"). 

##  

## bajan language
Bajan is similar to other Caribbean [creole](## "creolo") languages, but has its own characteristics. For example, the ‘th’ sound is replaced by ‘d’: so Bajans say ‘de’ instead of ‘the’; ‘dem’ instead of ‘them’; or ‘dat’ instead of ‘that’. ‘He’ or ‘she’ are often used as possessives, instead of ‘his’ or ‘her’. Some Bajan words are recognisable in American English: adaptations such as ‘dunna’ (didn’t) or ‘gonna’ (going to) are Bajan imports. The Bajan present tense drops the verb form and uses the word ‘do’ or ‘does’ with the infinitive: “I does guh church” is “I’m going to church”. The past tense does the same thing but with ‘did’: “I did wun guh tuh church” is “I wanted to go to church”. 

## bajan proverbs
Bajans are famous for their [wisdom](## "saggezza"). A few Bajan proverbs are:
**“Cat luck ain dog luck.” **Because something works for one person, doesn’t mean it will work for another.
**“Every [bush](## "cespuglio") is a man.”**Always be aware of what you say because people are always listening whether you [realise](## "rendersi conto") it or not.
**“Every pig got a Saturday.”**Eventually everyone will have to pay for their actions.
**“De higher de monkey [climb](## "arrampicarsi") de more he show he [tail](## "coda").” **The more you  [show off](## "vantarsi"), the more your inadequacies are revealed.
