The [recently-released](## "rilasciata recentemente") second season of HBO’s dark comedy series The White Lotus has been more successful than the first. This [clever](## "intelligente") social satire follows the fortunes of a number of [guests](## "ospiti") of the White Lotus luxury hotel [chain](## "catena"), as well as the [fates](## "destini") of the hotel staff members employed to make their [guests](## "ospiti")’ dreams come true. Originally intended to be a six-episode limited series, the first season, set in Hawaii, was such a hit that creator Mike White was persuaded to continue the series. The second season is set in [stunning](## "bellissima") Sicily.
In both seasons, the focus is simultaneously placed on both the hotel [guests](## "ospiti") and the hotel staff members, with [guests](## "ospiti") of more [humble](## "umile") origins [arguably](## "potenzialmente") acting as audience [surrogates](## "rappresentanti") who find themselves — sometimes quite literally — in bed with [wealth](## "ricchezza"). 

## class
The series incisively points to the vast economic inequalities experienced by its characters, their different worlds [intertwining](## "intrecciare") [to highlight](## "evidenziare") shocking contrasts. For instance, in the first season, hotel manager Armond, played by Murray Bartlett, has to simultaneously deal with Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge), a [wealth](## "ricchezza")y, [troubled](## "squilibrata") woman, who is desperate for a massage, and hotel [trainee](## "tirocinante") Lani (Jolene Purdy), who feels obliged [to disguise](## "coprire") her pregnancy [to avoid](## "evitare") missing the opportunity of getting a job at the White Lotus — and finds herself giving birth in her future [boss](## "capo")’ office.
The [stark](## "aspra, assoluta") difference between the [matters](## "problemi") worrying these women is [echoed](## "ripetere") in the second season, in which the personal, often [gender-based concerns](## "preoccupazioni in base al genere") of the [wealth](## "ricchezza")iest American characters are markedly different from those of the local non-[wealth](## "ricchezza")y characters, whose choices are restricted by class, culture and context.

## MONEY RULES 
The message of the show can barely be missed: money defines and structures all human experiences and relationships, [be they](## "siano") familial, professional or personal. Creator Mike White discussed this in an interview about the show:
**Mike White (American accent): **There’s the creative inspiration for me, which was, I’d always wanted to do a show just that [got into](## "interessarsi a") money and how money basically can pervert even our most intimate relationships, and how money has such an influence even within marriages, within interactions with[strangers](## "sconosciuti") and friends and loved ones. 

## SUSPENSE
Another important element in the success of The White Lotus is its use of suspense. Both seasons start with the audience [finding out](## "scoprire") that someone has just died. An aura of mystery and a sense of danger [surround](## "circondare") all [storylines](## "trame"). Starting with a body (or bodies!) being found may be an old [trick](## "trucco"), but it certainly keeps the audience [hooked](## "essere agganciato"). The show never ceases to be fun to watch, but there is a [lurking](## "stare in agguato") darkness [throughout](## "durante tutta") it which points to the [twisted](## "contorti") aspects of the inequality of the economic conditions experienced by its characters.
**Mike White: **[In] the first [couple](## "paio") of episodes you’re just following these tourists and then you [shift](## "cambiare, spostarsi") and start [to realise](## "rendersi conto") that there’s [ther are] problematic aspects to all of it, and how the vacation is not exactly escapism and that you’re right [in the thick of](## "nel mezzo di") all of these cultural [reckonings](## "prese di coscienza") that are happening.

## PANDEMIC BABY
The White Lotus is very much a product of the Covid-19 pandemic. White conceived of it as a show that could be made in an [isolated](## "isolato") location, where filming would not be interrupted by the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, and where actors could work in a safe environment.
**Mike White: **HBO came to me and they were stressing because, a lot of their shows had [to shut down](## "fermarsi") for Covid, so they were trying [to come up](## "trovare") with creators who could create a show that had a [lo-fi](## "a bassa impronta")  Covid footprint [in the hopes](## "nella speranza") that this show wouldn’t be shut down. So the idea of doing something in one location was kind of the mandate.
