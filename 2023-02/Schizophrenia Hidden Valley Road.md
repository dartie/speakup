Schizophrenia is one of the most mysterious and destructive of severe mental illnesses. A classification of symptoms [rather than](## "invece di") a specific condition, sufferers may have hallucinations, [delusions](## "deliri"), paranoia, catatonia and/or extremely disordered thinking and [behaviour](## "comportamento"). The illness progresses with psychotic episodes or ‘breaks’ that [damage](## "danneggiare") the brain, leading to more illness, [injuries](## "lesioni"), legal and financial difficulties, and even death. Schizophrenia affects around 1 per cent of the population directly, and [countless](## "innumerevoli") others indirectly. 

## freud vs. jung
The word ‘schizophrenia’ was first used in 1911. At that time, Sigmund Freud, the Austrian founder of psychoanalysis, wrote a case study based on the diary of a German [former](## "ex") judge called Daniel Schreber, who wrote about his experience of his own severe mental illness. Freud decided that Schreber suffered from an extreme form of neurosis and that his [delusions](## "deliri") could be interpreted the same way that dreams could. Others, however, including Freud’s friend and disciple Carl Jung, strongly [disagreed](## "non essere d’accordo"). Jung believed that there was something genetic or a physical defect in the brain that caused schizophrenia. That [argument](## "discussione") between [nurture](## "allevamento") (environmental factors) and nature (genetic factors) ended Freud and Jung’s professional relationship. It has had a major influence on the way the illness has been perceived, researched and treated [ever since](## "da allora").

## the galvins
Freud’s influence was at its [peak](## "cima") in 1960s America, when Don and Mimi Galvin, an [upper-middle class](## "classe medio-alta") Irish-Catholic couple were making their home in Colorado Springs in western US. Don worked as a teacher in a new Air Force academy, while Mimi [brought up](## "crescere") their family of ten boys and two girls. But by the time the [eldest](## "maggiore") son, Donald, had [reached](## "raggiungere") his 20s, the Galvin’s perfect lives were beginning [to fall apart](## "spezzarsi, distruggersi"). Donald’s [behaviour](## "comportamento") had become too strange and [threatening](## "minacciante") to ignore. With time, five of the other Galvin boys began [to display](## "manifestare") the symptoms of schizophrenia. 

## THE JOURNALIST
The illness devastated the entire Galvin family. But the Galvins were also essential to understanding schizophrenia better. It was rare that so many [siblings](## "fratelli (e sorelle)") suffer from the illness, and their genetic material proved vital for research. In 2017, the journalist Robert Kolker was asked by the youngest [siblings](## "fratelli (e sorelle)"), Margaret and Mary, to write their family’s story. As he put together the book, reading extensively and s[peak](## "cima")ing to family members, psychiatrists and geneticists about the illness, Kolker realised just how extraordinary the Galvins were.
