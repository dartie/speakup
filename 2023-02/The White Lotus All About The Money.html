<p>The <a href="##" title="rilasciata recentemente">recently-released</a> second season of HBO’s dark comedy series The White Lotus has been more successful than the first. This <a href="##" title="intelligente">clever</a> social satire follows the fortunes of a number of <a href="##" title="ospiti">guests</a> of the White Lotus luxury hotel <a href="##" title="catena">chain</a>, as well as the <a href="##" title="destini">fates</a> of the hotel staff members employed to make their <a href="##" title="ospiti">guests</a>’ dreams come true. Originally intended to be a six-episode limited series, the first season, set in Hawaii, was such a hit that creator Mike White was persuaded to continue the series. The second season is set in <a href="##" title="bellissima">stunning</a> Sicily.
In both seasons, the focus is simultaneously placed on both the hotel <a href="##" title="ospiti">guests</a> and the hotel staff members, with <a href="##" title="ospiti">guests</a> of more <a href="##" title="umile">humble</a> origins <a href="##" title="potenzialmente">arguably</a> acting as audience <a href="##" title="rappresentanti">surrogates</a> who find themselves — sometimes quite literally — in bed with <a href="##" title="ricchezza">wealth</a>. </p>

<h2 id="class">class</h2>

<p>The series incisively points to the vast economic inequalities experienced by its characters, their different worlds <a href="##" title="intrecciare">intertwining</a> <a href="##" title="evidenziare">to highlight</a> shocking contrasts. For instance, in the first season, hotel manager Armond, played by Murray Bartlett, has to simultaneously deal with Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge), a <a href="##" title="ricchezza">wealth</a>y, <a href="##" title="squilibrata">troubled</a> woman, who is desperate for a massage, and hotel <a href="##" title="tirocinante">trainee</a> Lani (Jolene Purdy), who feels obliged <a href="##" title="coprire">to disguise</a> her pregnancy <a href="##" title="evitare">to avoid</a> missing the opportunity of getting a job at the White Lotus — and finds herself giving birth in her future <a href="##" title="capo">boss</a>’ office.
The <a href="##" title="aspra, assoluta">stark</a> difference between the <a href="##" title="problemi">matters</a> worrying these women is <a href="##" title="ripetere">echoed</a> in the second season, in which the personal, often <a href="##" title="preoccupazioni in base al genere">gender-based concerns</a> of the <a href="##" title="ricchezza">wealth</a>iest American characters are markedly different from those of the local non-<a href="##" title="ricchezza">wealth</a>y characters, whose choices are restricted by class, culture and context.</p>

<h2 id="money-rules">MONEY RULES </h2>

<p>The message of the show can barely be missed: money defines and structures all human experiences and relationships, <a href="##" title="siano">be they</a> familial, professional or personal. Creator Mike White discussed this in an interview about the show:
**Mike White (American accent): **There’s the creative inspiration for me, which was, I’d always wanted to do a show just that <a href="##" title="interessarsi a">got into</a> money and how money basically can pervert even our most intimate relationships, and how money has such an influence even within marriages, within interactions with<a href="##" title="sconosciuti">strangers</a> and friends and loved ones. </p>

<h2 id="suspense">SUSPENSE</h2>

<p>Another important element in the success of The White Lotus is its use of suspense. Both seasons start with the audience <a href="##" title="scoprire">finding out</a> that someone has just died. An aura of mystery and a sense of danger <a href="##" title="circondare">surround</a> all <a href="##" title="trame">storylines</a>. Starting with a body (or bodies!) being found may be an old <a href="##" title="trucco">trick</a>, but it certainly keeps the audience <a href="##" title="essere agganciato">hooked</a>. The show never ceases to be fun to watch, but there is a <a href="##" title="stare in agguato">lurking</a> darkness <a href="##" title="durante tutta">throughout</a> it which points to the <a href="##" title="contorti">twisted</a> aspects of the inequality of the economic conditions experienced by its characters.
**Mike White: **[In] the first <a href="##" title="paio">couple</a> of episodes you’re just following these tourists and then you <a href="##" title="cambiare, spostarsi">shift</a> and start <a href="##" title="rendersi conto">to realise</a> that there’s [ther are] problematic aspects to all of it, and how the vacation is not exactly escapism and that you’re right <a href="##" title="nel mezzo di">in the thick of</a> all of these cultural <a href="##" title="prese di coscienza">reckonings</a> that are happening.</p>

<h2 id="pandemic-baby">PANDEMIC BABY</h2>

<p>The White Lotus is very much a product of the Covid-19 pandemic. White conceived of it as a show that could be made in an <a href="##" title="isolato">isolated</a> location, where filming would not be interrupted by the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, and where actors could work in a safe environment.
**Mike White: **HBO came to me and they were stressing because, a lot of their shows had <a href="##" title="fermarsi">to shut down</a> for Covid, so they were trying <a href="##" title="trovare">to come up</a> with creators who could create a show that had a <a href="##" title="a bassa impronta">lo-fi</a>  Covid footprint <a href="##" title="nella speranza">in the hopes</a> that this show wouldn’t be shut down. So the idea of doing something in one location was kind of the mandate.
