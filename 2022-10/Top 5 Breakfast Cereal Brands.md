**1. Cheerios**
This [ring-shaped](## "a forma di anello") cereal is both healthy and tasty in equal measures and has remained a best-selling brand in the US for decades. Gluten free and made with 100 per cent [whole-grain oats](## "fiocchi di avena integrale"), its manufacturer General Mills tested over five hundred formulas and numerous shapes and sizes of cereal before finding the winning combination.
This simple and not very nutritious breakfast cereal consists of [puffed rice](## "riso soffiato") and sugar. A firm favourite with kids, the key to its success is in its captivating [soundtrack](## "colonna sonora"); the orchestra of “[snap](## "schiocco"), [crackle](## "scricchiolio"), and [pop](## "esplosione")” that occurs when the milk hits the dry grains. [Cocoa](## "cacao") and [cinnamon](## "cannella") varieties add a degree of taste to what quickly turns into an ultra-sweet [sludge](## "impasto"). 
Kellogg’s variation on its [pioneering](## "essere il primo") Corn Flakes is a mix of lightly toasted rice, wheat and [barley](## "orzo"). High in fibre and with vitamins and [iron](## "ferro") added, it was introduced to help with weight loss and colon health. Not [altogether](## "in generale") [flavoursome](## "saporito"), many people add fruit to their bowl to make the cereal more [appetising](## "appetitoso").
Before breakfast cereals were sweetened and marketed as a fun product for children, people [settled for](## "accontentarsi") oat flakes [boiled](## "bollire") in water or milk, known as porridge in the UK and oatmeal in the US. Registered as the first trademark for a breakfast cereal in 1877, the recipe is as austere as the brand name would suggest.
Considered a cereal for adults, it is one of the healthier if [blander](## "più insipido") varieties on the market; [chunky](## "robuste") biscuits made of whole-grain wheat were just what Dr. Kellogg would have ordered for his patients. Invented in Australia in the 1920s, the cereal is now manufactured in the UK and Canada and exported to over eighty countries.
