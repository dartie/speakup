<p>Italian immigrants have had a <a href="##" title="enorme">huge</a> impact on the <a href="##" title="crogiolo">melting pot</a> that is American society. One of the most obvious areas of influence is food. When the first Italian immigrants arrived in the 1880s, US restaurants were <a href="##" title="per la maggior parte">mostly</a> Germanic in style, with pork dishes served in <a href="##" title="birrerie">beer halls</a>. Today, of the eight hundred thousand restaurants in the US, around one hundred thousand are Italian and Italian-American TV chefs are national celebrities.</p>

<h2 id="food">FOOD </h2>

<p>However, what are considered Italian dishes — pizza, spaghetti with <a href="##" title="polpette">meatballs</a>, <a href="##" title="parmigiana di pollo">chicken parmesan</a> — are American versions of the real Italian dishes. Pizza was born in Naples and was <a href="##" title="una volta">once</a> a street snack of pitta bread <a href="##" title="dare delle pennellate">dabbed with</a> tomato sauce. Transported to the US, immigrants added New World ingredients and started serving the dish in restaurants. Pizza is now as American as apple pie.</p>

<h2 id="hollywood">HOLLYWOOD</h2>

<p>Pizza often goes together with a movie, and there is nothing more American than Hollywood. However, Italian-Americans have also been <a href="##" title="illustri">prominent</a> in the film industry on both <a href="##" title="lati">sides</a> of the camera. <a href="##" title="presumibilmente">Arguably</a>, the first-ever sex symbol was the Italian- American actor Rudolph Valentino, who was followed by iconic stars such as Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta, Al Pacino, Robert de Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Italian-American directors include Frank Capra, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Ironically, <a href="##" title="tuttavia">though</a>, while Coppola’s Godfather films are considered classics, they helped reinforce negative Italian-American stereotypes…</p>

<h2 id="music">MUSIC</h2>

<p>Italian-Americans have also <a href="##" title="alzarsi, crescere">risen</a> high on the musical side of the <a href="##" title="intrattenimento, spettacolo">entertainment</a> industry. When television exploded in popularity in the 1950s, <a href="##" title="cantanti confidenziali">crooners</a> such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Perry Como and Dean Martin became major celebrities with their <a href="##" title="propi">own</a> TV shows. Their careers as singers had often begun in Italian restaurants, entertaining people while they ate. Their successors include superstars Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga.</p>
