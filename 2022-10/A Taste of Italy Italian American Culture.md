Italian immigrants have had a [huge](## "enorme") impact on the [melting pot](## "crogiolo") that is American society. One of the most obvious areas of influence is food. When the first Italian immigrants arrived in the 1880s, US restaurants were [mostly](## "per la maggior parte") Germanic in style, with pork dishes served in [beer halls](## "birrerie"). Today, of the eight hundred thousand restaurants in the US, around one hundred thousand are Italian and Italian-American TV chefs are national celebrities.

## FOOD 
However, what are considered Italian dishes — pizza, spaghetti with [meatballs](## "polpette"), [chicken parmesan](## "parmigiana di pollo") — are American versions of the real Italian dishes. Pizza was born in Naples and was [once](## "una volta") a street snack of pitta bread [dabbed with](## "dare delle pennellate") tomato sauce. Transported to the US, immigrants added New World ingredients and started serving the dish in restaurants. Pizza is now as American as apple pie.

## HOLLYWOOD
Pizza often goes together with a movie, and there is nothing more American than Hollywood. However, Italian-Americans have also been [prominent](## "illustri") in the film industry on both [sides](## "lati") of the camera. [Arguably](## "presumibilmente"), the first-ever sex symbol was the Italian- American actor Rudolph Valentino, who was followed by iconic stars such as Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta, Al Pacino, Robert de Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. Italian-American directors include Frank Capra, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Ironically, [though](## "tuttavia"), while Coppola’s Godfather films are considered classics, they helped reinforce negative Italian-American stereotypes…

## MUSIC
Italian-Americans have also [risen](## "alzarsi, crescere") high on the musical side of the [entertainment](## "intrattenimento, spettacolo") industry. When television exploded in popularity in the 1950s, [crooners](## "cantanti confidenziali") such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Perry Como and Dean Martin became major celebrities with their [own](## "propi") TV shows. Their careers as singers had often begun in Italian restaurants, entertaining people while they ate. Their successors include superstars Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga.
