<p>Ormai sono un elemento fondamentale delle colazioni di tutto il mondo, ma i cereali così come li conosciamo oggi nacquero per sbaglio alla fine del 1800 negli Stati Uniti, quando i fratelli Kellogg tentarono di riciclare del grano raffermo per servirlo ai pazienti della loro clinica.</p>

<p>The process is very simple: open the box, let the cereals fall into the <a href="##" title="ciotola">bowl</a>, <a href="##" title="versare">pour</a> some milk on it, and enjoy! Breakfast cereals are an everyday <a href="##" title="alimento base">staple</a> in homes <a href="##" title="in tutto">throughout</a> the Western world with numerous varieties on offer. Although warm cereals like <a href="##" title="fiocchi d’avena cotti serviti con latte o acqua">porridge</a> (oatmeal in the US) have a long history globally, it is products by the US company Kellogg’s that have really revolutionised breakfast time – <a href="##" title="nel bene e nel male">for better, and for worse</a>. It all started in a medical spa and resort in Michigan known as the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and with the invention of the <a href="##" title="umile">humble</a> <a href="##" title="fiocco di mais">corn flake</a>.</p>

<h2 id="good-morning-america">GOOD MORNING AMERICA</h2>

<p>Breakfast in America traditionally consisted of <a href="##" title="resti">leftovers</a> from the night before, <a href="##" title="pasticcio">hash</a>, or fried foods such as eggs and sausages. When the industrial revolution came, people were <a href="##" title="spronare">urged</a> to spend less time preparing food. At the same time, diseases like tuberculosis became common, and doctors <a href="##" title="avvisare">warned</a> against the evils of refined <a href="##" title="carboidrati">carbs</a> and meat. </p>

<h2 id="an-accidental-invention">AN ACCIDENTAL INVENTION</h2>

<p>John Harvey Kellogg was a <a href="##" title="medico">physician</a> with a passion for healthy living. In 1886 he established Battle Creek, a <a href="##" title="ritiro di benessere">wellness retreat</a> where he treated his patients with <a href="##" title="vegetariano">plant-based</a> diets designed to calm their minds and <a href="##" title="frenare">curb</a> their sexual urges. 
Looking for plain foods that would improve his patients’ digestive health, Dr. Kellogg started experimenting with cereal. There are several versions of how ‘<a href="##" title="fiocco di mais">corn flake</a>s’ were invented. According to the Kellogg Company, in 1898, John Kellogg and his brother Will were trying to make granola when they left a piece of <a href="##" title="grano">wheat</a>-based <a href="##" title="impasto">dough</a> unwatched, causing it to ferment. When compressed in thin <a href="##" title="strati">sheets</a>, the <a href="##" title="impasto">dough</a> produced flakes that became <a href="##" title="croccante">crispy</a> when toasted in the oven. Will Kellogg kept working on the recipe and discovered that corn produced even <a href="##" title="più croccante">crunchier</a> flakes. They served them at the <a href="##" title="casa di cura">sanitarium</a>, and the patients loved them. <a href="##" title="essere testimone">Witnessing</a> this reaction, Will Kellogg decided to sell them to the general public. His brother wasn’t interested in this commercial venture, so Will bought the rights to the recipe and, in 1906, founded the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company.</p>

<h2 id="wide-distribution">WIDE DISTRIBUTION</h2>

<p>The <a href="##" title="compimento">completion</a> of the transcontinental railroad meant that the United States were more connected than ever and that a mass market was available for entrepreneurs like Kellogg. He invested in <a href="##" title="pubblicità">advertising</a> campaigns that presented his <a href="##" title="fiocco di mais">corn flake</a>s as an attractive as well as healthy snack — distancing the product from his brother’s conviction that cereal would reduce one’s sex <a href="##" title="impulso">drive</a>. Sales <a href="##" title="impennarsi">shot up</a>, and by 1909 the company was manufacturing 120.000 boxes of Corn Flakes a day. <a href="##" title="indignato">Resentful</a> of his brother’s success, John Kellogg <a href="##" title="denunciare">sued</a> Will for the use of the family name, but lost.</p>

<h2 id="a-modern-company">A MODERN COMPANY</h2>

<p>Will Kellogg <a href="##" title="distinguersi per, concentrarsi su">was all about</a> innovation, and he kept experimenting with food production. When the Big Depression <a href="##" title="colpire">struck</a> in 1929, Kellogg’s doubled its <a href="##" title="pubblicità">advertising</a> and accelerated production. Will also cut working hours in his factories from forty to thirty hours a week, improving production figures without reducing salaries. However, rival cereal products were starting to appear, and Kellogg’s needed an <a href="##" title="vantaggio">edge</a>.</p>

<h2 id="too-much-sugar">TOO MUCH SUGAR!</h2>

<p>When he founded his company, Will Kellogg thought that adding some sugar to the <a href="##" title="fiocco di mais">corn flake</a>s would make them even <a href="##" title="più saporiti">tastier</a> — and he was right. From the 1950s on, however, new varieties of <a href="##" title="fiocco di mais">corn flake</a>s were introduced making the cereal even sweeter, as children were <a href="##" title="puntare a">targeted</a> as a lucrative market. Honey, <a href="##" title="mandorle">almonds</a>, strawberry purée or, simply, more sugar were added. Parents began to <a href="##" title="rendersi conto">notice</a> their kids experienced increasing hyperactivity in the mornings and <a href="##" title="cali a mezzogiorno">midday slumps</a>, while their <a href="##" title="peso">weight</a> <a href="##" title="impennarsi">shot up</a>. In the last few decades, national regulations have been introduced to control the amount of sugar in cereals. 
Today the original Kellogg’s Corn Flakes is still considered a nutritious breakfast. Present in 180 countries around the world, the recipe for the cereal that <a href="##" title="rivoluzionare">shook up</a> breakfast time remains the same as it was a hundred years ago.</p>
