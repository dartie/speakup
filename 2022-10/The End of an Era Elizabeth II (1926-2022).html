<p>La morte della Regina Elisabetta II rappresenta la scomparsa di un simbolo di altri tempi. La più longeva tra i regnanti della storia britannica, era, più che una semplice governante, l’incarnazione di un’istituzione che garantiva coesione e un senso di continuità per una società che si trova immersa in una crisi di identità.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth II, who died last month, was the <a href="##" title="che ha regnato più a lungo">longest-serving</a> monarch in British history, finally accumulating an incredible seventy years on the throne. Yet Elizabeth was never actually expected to become queen! When she was born in 1926, she was third in line to the throne. However, when her uncle, King Edward VIII, <a href="##" title="inaspettatamente">unexpectedly</a> abdicated in 1936, her father became monarch as King George VI. Elizabeth then ascended the throne when her father died on 6 February, 1952, <a href="##" title="all'età di">aged</a> just fifty-six. She was <a href="##" title="incoronare">crowned</a> Queen on 2 June, 1953, in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<h2 id="effective-monarch">effective monarch</h2>

<p>Elizabeth II is generally considered to have been a highly effective monarch, with some considerable <a href="##" title="risultati">achievements</a>. There were also, inevitably, some mistakes. One of her greatest <a href="##" title="risultati">achievements</a> was something completely intangible: all these years she was a <a href="##" title="porto sicuro, rifugio">safe harbou</a> for millions of people, someone that was always there in an <a href="##" title="in continuo cambiamento">ever-changing</a> world. Her attitude was apolitical, so she rarely divided the country.</p>

<h2 id="public-work">Public Work</h2>

<p>Elizabeth II took her public work extremely seriously. For most of her life she <a href="##" title="portare a termine">carried out</a> more than four hundred public <a href="##" title="impegni">engagements</a> every year. She was also the <a href="##" title="patrona">patron</a> of more than six hundred British <a href="##" title="associazioni benefiche">chari<a href="##" title="legami">ties</a></a> and organisations, and helped <a href="##" title="raccogliere">raise</a> almost £1.5 billion, mostly for <a href="##" title="associazioni benefiche">chari<a href="##" title="legami">ties</a></a> trying to reduce poverty.</p>

<h2 id="royal-image">Royal Image</h2>

<p>The Queen also <a href="##" title="migliorare">improved</a> and modernised the monarchy’s public image. She made the royal family more <a href="##" title="accessibile">approachable</a>. In 1969, the Queen permitted a TV <a href="##" title="troupe">crew</a> to follow her and her family for two months. The two-hour documentary, The Royal Family, showed the royals as a family for the first time. The Queen, however, quickly <a href="##" title="pentirsi">regretted</a> her decision. The documentary affected the mystery and glamour of the monarchy, and possibly facilitated the invasive tabloid <a href="##" title="copertura">coverage</a> of recent decades.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-people">Meeting People</h2>

<p>The Queen gave few interviews during her reign, but she was determined to see the public. In 1970, during a royal tour of Australia, she ignored centuries of tradition and took a casual <a href="##" title="giro">stroll</a>  —a <a href="##" title="a spasso">walkabout</a>— among the <a href="##" title="folle">crowds</a>. This became a regular practice in the royal family. The Queen was also determined <a href="##" title="mantenersi aggiornata">to keep up to date</a> with changes in technology. In 1976, she was the first monarch to send an email. Twenty-one years later, she launched a website detailing her charitable activi<a href="##" title="legami">ties</a> and the work of the royal family. She was also quick to use Twitter and Instagram. </p>

<h2 id="soft-power">Soft Power</h2>

<p>The Queen was a Head of State but not a Head of Government. She personified <a href="##" title="leggero, senza l'uso della forza">soft</a> power. During her reign she became the world’s most powerful <a href="##" title="figura di rappresentanza">figurehead</a>, using her superpower — royal <a href="##" title="colla">glue</a> — to preside over the transformation from a British Empire, covering 25 per cent of the world, to a voluntary association of <a href="##" title="sovrane">sovereign</a> nations, the Commonwealth, currently comprising fifty-four states in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and the Pacific. The Commonwealth promotes socio-economic and cultural <a href="##" title="legami">ties</a>. <a href="##" title="in tutto">Throughout</a> her reign, the Queen supported racial equality and advancement.</p>

<h2 id="healing-process">Healing Process</h2>

<p>Elizabeth II also used her <a href="##" title="leggero, senza l'uso della forza">soft</a> power in the recent <a href="##" title="tentativi">attempts</a> <a href="##" title="guarire">to heal</a> the long, <a href="##" title="sanguinaria">bloody</a> relationship between England and Ireland, which reached a violent climax last century with decades-long acts of horrific terrorist violence. These were mostly ended by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The Queen also played her role when she made the first monarch’s visit to Ireland in 2011. She <a href="##" title="ristabilire">reset</a> relations between the two countries simply by showing respect to those who had died fighting England. The Queen was also the first British monarch to <a href="##" title="discorso">address</a> Congress, in 1991, more than two hundred years after the US won independence from British government.</p>

<h2 id="domestic-changes">Domestic Changes</h2>

<p>The Queen also made some important changes at home during her reign. Through the Crown <a href="##" title="legge">Act</a>, 2013, she made the succession more <a href="##" title="equo">equitable</a>. The <a href="##" title="legge">Act</a> ended centuries of history of the <a href="##" title="maggiore">eldest</a> son being the <a href="##" title="erede">heir</a> to the throne even if he had an older sister. It also allowed the monarch to marry a Catholic. In addition, Elizabeth II reformed the monarchy’s finances, responding to public criticism of the <a href="##" title="spese">expenses</a> of the royal family. In the 1990s, the Queen began to pay <a href="##" title="tasse">taxes</a> on royal <a href="##" title="reddito">income</a> which had been exempt for years.</p>

<h2 id="monarchy-mistakes">Monarchy Mistakes</h2>

<p>During the Queen’s long reign, there were, of course, mistakes. The Royal Family documentary affected the mystery of the monarchy. Three years earlier, however, Elizabeth II made what she considered her worst mistake. In 1966, 116 children and twenty-eight adults died in a <a href="##" title="carbone">coal</a> mining disaster in Aberfan, Wales. The Queen delayed her visit for a week, possibly thinking her presence would affect the <a href="##" title="salvataggio">rescue</a> efforts. She appeared <a href="##" title="insensibile">heartless</a>. The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, was also <a href="##" title="affrontare, gestire">handled</a> badly. The Queen <a href="##" title="giudicare male">misjudged</a> the public <a href="##" title="umore, stato d'animo">mood</a>, <a href="##" title="rifiutare">refusing</a> to allow the national flag to fly <a href="##" title="a mezz'asta">at half mast</a> over Buckingham Palace. Realising her mistake, she gave a rare televised <a href="##" title="discorso">address</a> about the People’s Princess &hellip; and the flag appeared, on the day of the funeral. In recent times a perhaps yet more shocking scandal emerged, with serious sexual misconduct allegations against Prince Andrew, the Queen’s favourite son.</p>

<h2 id="national-symbol">National Symbol</h2>

<p>With the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the world has lost one of its most recognised and popular figures. During her reign, the monarch served as Britain’s most important symbol of national identity and <a href="##" title="orgoglio">pride</a>. One thing is clear: the new King will <a href="##" title="riempire">have some very big shoes to fill</a>!</p>

<h2 id="15-facts-about-the-queen">15 facts about the queen</h2>
