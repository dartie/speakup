<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Hi! I’m looking for a book called &ldquo;The Hate <a href="##" title="tu (informale)">U</a> Give&rdquo;. There was a film based on it.
<strong>Clara</strong>: Are you a member?
<strong>Tom</strong>: Do I have to be?
<strong>Clara</strong>: No, you can read books here, but <a href="##" title="iscrizione">membership</a> is free and you can <strong>borrow </strong><a href="##" title="fino a">up to</a> ten books <a href="##" title="alla volta">at a time</a>.
<strong>Tom</strong>: How long can I keep them for?
<strong>Clara</strong>: You can keep them for a month. If you want them <a href="##" title="per più tempo">any longer</a>, you can renew them online or by phone.
<strong>Tom</strong>: What happens if I haven’t returned them by the <strong><a href="##" title="scadenza">due</a> date</strong>?
<strong>Clara</strong>: Well, you should bring them back <a href="##" title="puntuale">on time</a> and there’s a <strong>drop-off</strong> box that’s open <strong><sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub></strong>. But there is <strong>a fine</strong> of £1 a day per <strong>over<a href="##" title="scadenza">due</a></strong>book.
<strong>Tom</strong>: That’s reasonable. What about the book I asked for? I know some people consider it controversial.
<strong>Clara</strong>: Let me check our catalogue. Oh, look, here it is: &ldquo;The Hate <a href="##" title="tu (informale)">U</a> Give&rdquo; by Angie Thomas. <a href="##" title="vuoi che...?">Shall I</a> <strong>sign you up</strong>?
<strong>Tom</strong>: OK, let’s do it. I’ll have a <strong>b<a href="##" title="file">rows</a>e</strong> to see what else you have. Where can I find the young adult fiction section?
<strong>Clara</strong>: It’s on <strong>aisle</strong> nine, at the back on the left. Welcome to our library!</p>

<p><strong>To borrow</strong> is to take something with you for a short time, before returning it.
‘<a href="##" title="prestare">To lend</a>’, on the other hand, is to give something to someone for a short time, before it is returned to you. The two verbs are often <a href="##" title="confondere">mixed up</a>!
The ‘<strong><a href="##" title="scadenza">due</a> date</strong>’ is the date on which the books must be returned; in other words, the date on which they are ‘<a href="##" title="scadenza">due</a>’.
<strong>To drop</strong> something off means to take something to a particular place. Here, the library has a box so members can drop off the books outside of opening times.
<strong><sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub></strong>refers to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which essentially means any time.
<strong>A fine</strong> is a sum of money that must be paid when you break the rules.
<strong>Over<a href="##" title="scadenza">due</a></strong> means ‘late’.
<strong>To sign up</strong> is to <a href="##" title="unirsi">join</a>, to register, to become a member.
<strong>To b<a href="##" title="file">rows</a>e</strong> is to take a casual look. B<a href="##" title="file">rows</a>e can also be used as a noun, as in to have a b<a href="##" title="file">rows</a>e’.
An ‘<strong>aisle</strong>’ in a library is a passage between the <a href="##" title="file">rows</a> of <a href="##" title="scaffali">bookshelves</a>.</p>
