**Tom**: Hi! I’m looking for a book called "The Hate [U](## "tu (informale)") Give". There was a film based on it.
**Clara**: Are you a member?
**Tom**: Do I have to be?
**Clara**: No, you can read books here, but [membership](## "iscrizione") is free and you can **borrow **[up to](## "fino a") ten books [at a time](## "alla volta").
**Tom**: How long can I keep them for?
**Clara**: You can keep them for a month. If you want them [any longer](## "per più tempo"), you can renew them online or by phone.
**Tom**: What happens if I haven’t returned them by the **[due](## "scadenza") date**?
**Clara**: Well, you should bring them back [on time](## "puntuale") and there’s a **drop-off** box that’s open **24/7**. But there is **a fine** of £1 a day per **over[due](## "scadenza")**book.
**Tom**: That’s reasonable. What about the book I asked for? I know some people consider it controversial.
**Clara**: Let me check our catalogue. Oh, look, here it is: "The Hate [U](## "tu (informale)") Give" by Angie Thomas. [Shall I](## "vuoi che...?") **sign you up**?
**Tom**: OK, let’s do it. I’ll have a **b[rows](## "file")e** to see what else you have. Where can I find the young adult fiction section?
**Clara**: It’s on **aisle** nine, at the back on the left. Welcome to our library!

## NOW LET’S  REVIEW  THE  VOCAB[U](## "tu (informale)")LARY!
**To borrow** is to take something with you for a short time, before returning it.
‘[To lend](## "prestare")’, on the other hand, is to give something to someone for a short time, before it is returned to you. The two verbs are often [mixed up](## "confondere")!
The ‘**[due](## "scadenza") date**’ is the date on which the books must be returned; in other words, the date on which they are ‘[due](## "scadenza")’.
**To drop** something off means to take something to a particular place. Here, the library has a box so members can drop off the books outside of opening times.
**24/7**refers to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which essentially means any time.
**A fine** is a sum of money that must be paid when you break the rules.
**Over[due](## "scadenza")** means ‘late’.
**To sign up** is to [join](## "unirsi"), to register, to become a member.
**To b[rows](## "file")e** is to take a casual look. B[rows](## "file")e can also be used as a noun, as in [to have a b[rows](## "file")e](## "dare un’occhiata")’.
An ‘**aisle**’ in a library is a passage between the [rows](## "file") of [bookshelves](## "scaffali").
