<p>La bandiera scozzese è caratterizzata da una croce a forma di X che simboleggia Sant’Andrea, il santo patrono della Scozia. Sebbene non sia così conosciuto come l’Hogmanay e la Burns Night, il giorno di Sant’Andrea rimane una ricorrenza importante, celebrata in tutto il Paese il 30 novembre di ogni anno.</p>

<p>Scots welcome the winter with a celebration of their patron saint on 30 November. St. Andrew’s Day is a voluntary bank holiday and cèilidhs take place the <a href="##" title="in lunghezza e larghezza">length and breadth of</a> the country. Cèilidhs are social <a href="##" title="celebrazioni">gatherings</a> that feature traditional food, drink, music and dancing.</p>

<h2 id="fisherman-saint">FISHERMAN SAINT</h2>

<p>Not a lot is known about the saint himself. Ironically, he never <a href="##" title="mettere piede">set foot</a> in Scotland. He and his brother Simon Peter were fishermen from Galilee and the first of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. In 60AD, he was martyred for his beliefs: he was crucified by the Romans in Patras, Greece. It is said that he thought himself <a href="##" title="indegno">unworthy</a> of dying in the same way as Jesus. He was therefore <a href="##" title="legare">bound</a> to an <a href="##" title="con forma di x">X-shaped</a> cross, known as a ‘<a href="##" title="croce di Sant’Andrea">saltire</a>’. The cross of the <a href="##" title="croce di Sant’Andrea">saltire</a> became his symbol and the day of his crucifixion became his saint day.</p>

<h2 id="relics">RELICS</h2>

<p>Some of his relics — a <a href="##" title="rotula">kneecap</a>, arm and finger bone — arrived in Scotland after his death and were housed in a chapel in Kilrymont, later renamed St. Andrews. It became a site of <a href="##" title="pellegrinaggio">pilgrimage</a>, and in 1158, a cathedral was built to house the reliquary. In 1320, the Declaration of Arbroath officially named him Scotland’s patron saint. Both cathedral and relics were destroyed during the Reformation. The Archbishop of Amalfi — who shares the same patron saint, along with Barbados, <a href="##" title="Cipro">Cyprus</a> Greece, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and Tenerife — donated a piece of Andrew’s <a href="##" title="scapola">shoulder blade</a>. The relics now reside in St. Mary’s Cathedral in Edinburgh.</p>

<h2 id="scottish-victory">SCOTTISH VICTORY</h2>

<p>The flag of Scotland also features the <a href="##" title="croce di Sant’Andrea">saltire</a> cross in white against a blue background. According to legend, St. Andrew appeared to King Angus the night before a battle against the <a href="##" title="Angli">Angles</a> in 862, promising him victory. The next day, the armies saw a cross-shaped cloud formation against a blue sky and, though <a href="##" title="inferiorità numerica">outnumbered</a>, the Scots won. It is the oldest flag still in use in Europe.</p>

<h2 id="immigrants">IMMIGRANTS</h2>

<p>Celebrating St. Andrew’s Day became popular among immigrants in America in the 18th century, to honour their Scottish roots. It then took hold in the ‘home country’. While festivities are more <a href="##" title="basso profilo">low-key</a> than during Hogmanay or Burns Night, St. Andrew’s Day is still one of Scotland’s most important holidays.</p>
