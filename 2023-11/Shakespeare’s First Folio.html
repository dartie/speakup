<p>La prima raccolta delle opere di Shakespeare è uno dei libri più importanti della letteratura mondiale. Pubblicata per la prima volta nel 1623, sette anni dopo la morte del genio di Stratford-upon-Avon, dei 750 esemplari stampati ne rimangono 233. Il suo prezzo all’asta ha raggiunto quasi i dieci milioni di dollari.</p>

<p>Four hundred years ago, in November 1623, a volume of plays appeared on a <a href="##" title="bancarella dei libri">bookstall</a> in the market in St. Paul’s <a href="##" title="cimitero">churchyard</a>. Two years in preparation, the book was entitled Mr. William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies. Shakespeare had died seven years earlier, and two of his actor colleagues, Henry Condell and John Heminges, were determined that his art should not die with him.</p>

<h2 id="bard-s-first-collection">BARD’S FIRST COLLECTION</h2>

<p>The printing of the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays was a slow, <a href="##" title="complesso">intricate</a> process, using the writer’s own manuscripts (none of which survives today), theatre <a href="##" title="imbeccata">prompt</a> copies and old, small <a href="##" title="formato in-quarto (8 pagine)">quarto</a> editions. Only half of the thirty-six plays in the book’s nine hundred pages had been published before, so Condell and Heminges’ act saved for posterity such literary classics as Macbeth, Twelfth Night and Julius Caesar.</p>

<h2 id="the-book-s-importance">THE BOOK’S IMPORTANCE</h2>

<p>The First Folio (it was not called this until later) is probably the most important book in English, due to its effect on both language and culture in English-speaking countries. It is the basis of Shakespeare’s <a href="##" title="fama, notorietà">renown</a> in all parts of the world, including places he never knew existed. The book even fixed his physical image for all time, with Martin Droeshout’s <a href="##" title="copertina">frontispiece</a> of the <a href="##" title="che sta diventando calvo">balding</a> <a href="##" title="drammaturgo">playwright</a>.</p>

<h2 id="libraries-and-museums">LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS</h2>

<p>Printer William Jaggard made 750 copies of Shakespeare’s works, for sale at fifteen shillings <a href="##" title="non rilegato">unbound</a> and one pound bound. There are now 235 copies in existence, most of them in libraries and museums — the US has 149 and Britain fifty (the British Library keeps five copies.) There is a burnt copy, impossible to recognise, reverently protected in a glass sarcophagus in the University of Pennsylvania. There are probably twenty-seven in private hands, with few likely to enter the open market. In 2020 a <a href="##" title="incunabolo">rare book</a> <a href="##" title="commerciante di oggetti d’antiquariato">dealer</a>, Stephen Lowentheil, paid $9.98 million for a copy.    </p>

<h2 id="for-all-time">FOR ALL TIME</h2>

<p>According to Professor Emma Smith, author of The Making of Shakespeare’s First Folio, corrections while printing mean that “each copy is a unique <a href="##" title="raccolta">collation</a>” — there were also errors from a <a href="##" title="noncurante">careless</a> teenage apprentice at Jaggard’s <a href="##" title="tipografia">printing shop</a>! Many copies also have annotations, <a href="##" title="scarabocchi">doodles</a> and markings from owners (and marks from their pets!) made over the centuries.   
Posterity <a href="##" title="dovere">owes</a> Shakespeare’s friends, Condell and Heminges, an enormous debt. Their determination to preserve the <a href="##" title="drammaturgo">playwright</a>’s legacy has meant that Shakespeare “was not of an age, but for all time”, in the famous words of his friend Ben Jonson’s dedicatory poem.</p>
