**Isa**: So, let’s take a look at your blood test results.
**Kim**: Oh, doctor, how bad is it?
**Isa**: Hmm, actually, it’s looking quite good, but your cholesterol is on the high side.
**Kim**: I knew it! [I’m going to have a heart attack, aren’t I](## "avrò…vero?")? Or diabetes?
**Isa**: Please, calm yourself! You just need [to improve](## "migliorare") your diet.
**Kim**: Right, wholemeal everything and nothing nice, I [guess](## "supporre").
**Isa**: Not at all. Just follow the Mediterranean diet. It’s low in saturated [fats](## "grasso") and very [tasty](## "gustosa"), too.
**Kim**: Mediterranean diet? What’s that, sardines and olive oil?
Isa: Yes, but lots of other things, too. Basically, try to choose [whole foods](## "alimenti integrali") that aren’t processed, like fruit, vegetables, [nuts](## "frutta secca"), lean meat and fish. 
**Kim**: What about alcohol?
**Isa**: There’s nothing wrong with a glass of wine with your dinner or the occasional beer at the weekend.
**Kim**: Alright then, that’s doesn’t sound too bad at all! 

## NOW  LET’S  REVIEW  THE  VOCABULARY!
**Take a look** is the same as ‘examine’. You can simply say ‘look’ without changing the meaning.
**On the high side** means a little bit high. You can use the construction with other adjectives, too: on the small side, on the heavy side, etc.
**I knew it**! is an exclamation you use to confirm something you had already [guess](## "supporre")ed.
A **heart attack** is another phrase for coronary or cardiac [arrest](## "arresto").
Food made from [flour](## "farina") containing the whole grain is described as **wholemeal** or ‘wholegrain’.
**Not at all means** ‘definitely not’. The expression is also used as a polite response to someone saying thank you.
**Lean meat**refers to meat with a low fat content, such as chicken or [turkey](## "tacchino").
In this context, **occasional** means ‘infrequent’.
Not too bad or ‘**not bad**’ is a casual way of saying ‘quite good’.
