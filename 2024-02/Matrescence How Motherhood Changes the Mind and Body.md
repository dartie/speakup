# Matrescence: How Motherhood Changes the Mind and Body   [B1]

Un nuovo movimento invita a riconoscere la transizione alla genitorialità, caratterizzata dai cambiamenti fisici, psicologici ed emotivi che donne e uomini sperimentano durante questa fase della vita, denominata ‘matrescenza’ nel caso delle donne.

We all know that adolescence is a difficult phase of life, when our hormones fluctuate, our bodies change and we form a new sense of identity. But what about new [parenthood](## "genitorialità")? The term ‘matrescence’ was [coined](## "coniare") in the 1970s by medical anthropologist Dana Raphael and it refers to the developmental phase of new [motherhood](## "maternità"). Just like adolescence, matrescence is a phase when women go through intense physical, psychological and emotional changes. More recent research shows that the brains of new fathers experience similar changes.

## A GLOBAL MOVEMENT
While adolescence has been widely studied and discussed for decades, new [parenthood](## "genitorialità") is only now getting the attention it [deserves](## "meritare") in the medical community and society. This is thanks to a global movement that recognises it as an equally difficult and important phase of life. The movement has resulted in an increased number of support groups and other [resources](## "risorse") for new mothers to help women and men transition into [parenthood](## "genitorialità").

## TOTALLY NORMAL
Society often presents [pregnancy](## "gravidanza") and early [parenthood](## "genitorialità") as a glorious phase of life. However, up to 20 per cent of women suffer from postpartum depression, and many others from anxiety, psychosis and other mental health problems during early [parenthood](## "genitorialità") in particular. Experts say it’s important [to raise awareness](## "aumentare la consapevolezza") of how common this is, so that women and men don’t feel [isolated](## "isolate") or afraid to express openly how they feel and get the help that they need. 

## CHANGES IN THE BRAIN
Women’s bodies change radically during [pregnancy](## "gravidanza"). Naturally, they are psychologically impacted by these physical changes and by the hormonal fluctuations that occur during the development of the foetus. In 2016, a scientific study by researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona discovered that women’s brains also change during [pregnancy](## "gravidanza") and that these changes are still present two years after giving birth.

## MATERNAL BONDS
The researchers did brain scans on [first-time mothers](## "madri alla prima esperienza") before and after [pregnancy](## "gravidanza"). They found that [pregnancy](## "gravidanza") alters the size and structure of regions of the brain involved in understanding the thoughts, feelings, [beliefs](## "credenze") and intentions of others. Two years after giving birth, the changes were so evident that a computer algorithm could use them to identify which women had been pregnant and which had not... However, a growing body of research is observing this type of plasticity in first-time fathers, too. They also experience the cognitive, physical and emotional demands of caring for a [newborn](## "neonato").
