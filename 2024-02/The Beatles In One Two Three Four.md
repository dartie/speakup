## THE BEATLES IN ONE TWO THREE FOUR
No strangers to drink and drugs, the Beatles had never tried marijuana. It was not until they were in New York in the summer of 1964 that they were introduced to it by Bob Dylan. The [foursome](## "quartetto") were in [awe](## "in soggezione") of the folk singer and didn’t [dare](## "osare") to refuse him when he offered them a [joint](## "canna"). Ringo went first and was [unaware](## "non essere a conoscenza") of the custom of passing it around: he smoked the whole thing! Dylan ended up giving each Beatle his own [joint](## "canna"). They enjoyed the experience so much, it became part of their lives and their songs. Paul McCartney later confessed that Got to Get You Into My Life was, in fact, an “ode to [pot](## "marijuana").”
An act of delinquency turned into an unforgettable experience for teenager Angela McGowan. She had [swiped](## "fregare") Ringo Starr’s [necklace](## "collana") — a St. Christopher medal — when the Beatles were [mobbed](## "assalire") on the way to a radio interview in New York, that same summer of 1964. He was [distraught](## "sconvolto"): he had worn it every day since his Auntie Nancy gave it to him on his twenty-first birthday. [Live on air](## "in diretta"), disc jockey ‘Cousin Brucie’ Morrow announced that whoever returned it would get a kiss from Ringo. St. Christopher medals [flew out](## "volare") of the shops in Manhattan, but the DJ identified the true [culprit](## "colpevole"). The next day, Angie and three of her friends got the promised kiss, in front of a full camera [crew](## "squadra").
Eric Clague was a young police [constable](## "agente") when a young woman [stepped](## "mettersi, camminare") in front of his car while he was driving. She died from the impact and, although the incident was declared an accident, he left the force and became a postman. He discovered later on that the woman he had killed was John Lennon’s mother, Julia. By coincidence, Paul McCartney’s old house was on his postal route and he had to deliver fan mail every day. A reporter from the Sunday Mirror tracked him [down](## "rintracciare") in 1998. Clague said: “It is something I have always kept deep inside. I haven’t even told my wife and children. I suppose I will have to now.”
Ringo Starr was having his [tonsils](## "tonsille") out at the start of the Beatles’ 1964 world tour. They hired a replacement drummer, Jimmie Nicol, whose career had been up and [down](## "rintracciare") until that point. His hair and his clothes were altered and, for ten days, he lived the life of a Beatle, joining in the concerts, press conferences and parties. On Ringo’s arrival in Melbourne, Nicol was [presented with](## "regalare") an [engraved](## "inciso") watch and £500 and put on a plane back home. Bad luck, bad decisions and a certain amount of arrogance meant that Jimmie’s career continued going [down](## "rintracciare")hill until, eventually, he [vanished](## "sparire") into obscurity, forever [blaming](## "incolpare") his time with the Beatles for his misfortune.
