<p>Un nuovo movimento invita a riconoscere la transizione alla genitorialità, caratterizzata dai cambiamenti fisici, psicologici ed emotivi che donne e uomini sperimentano durante questa fase della vita, denominata ‘matrescenza’ nel caso delle donne.</p>

<p>We all know that adolescence is a difficult phase of life, when our hormones fluctuate, our bodies change and we form a new sense of identity. But what about new <a href="##" title="genitorialità">parenthood</a>? The term ‘matrescence’ was <a href="##" title="coniare">coined</a> in the 1970s by medical anthropologist Dana Raphael and it refers to the developmental phase of new <a href="##" title="maternità">motherhood</a>. Just like adolescence, matrescence is a phase when women go through intense physical, psychological and emotional changes. More recent research shows that the brains of new fathers experience similar changes.</p>

<h2 id="a-global-movement">A GLOBAL MOVEMENT</h2>

<p>While adolescence has been widely studied and discussed for decades, new <a href="##" title="genitorialità">parenthood</a> is only now getting the attention it <a href="##" title="meritare">deserves</a> in the medical community and society. This is thanks to a global movement that recognises it as an equally difficult and important phase of life. The movement has resulted in an increased number of support groups and other <a href="##" title="risorse">resources</a> for new mothers to help women and men transition into <a href="##" title="genitorialità">parenthood</a>.</p>

<h2 id="totally-normal">TOTALLY NORMAL</h2>

<p>Society often presents <a href="##" title="gravidanza">pregnancy</a> and early <a href="##" title="genitorialità">parenthood</a> as a glorious phase of life. However, up to 20 per cent of women suffer from postpartum depression, and many others from anxiety, psychosis and other mental health problems during early <a href="##" title="genitorialità">parenthood</a> in particular. Experts say it’s important <a href="##" title="aumentare la consapevolezza">to raise awareness</a> of how common this is, so that women and men don’t feel <a href="##" title="isolate">isolated</a> or afraid to express openly how they feel and get the help that they need. </p>

<h2 id="changes-in-the-brain">CHANGES IN THE BRAIN</h2>

<p>Women’s bodies change radically during <a href="##" title="gravidanza">pregnancy</a>. Naturally, they are psychologically impacted by these physical changes and by the hormonal fluctuations that occur during the development of the foetus. In 2016, a scientific study by researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona discovered that women’s brains also change during <a href="##" title="gravidanza">pregnancy</a> and that these changes are still present two years after giving birth.</p>

<h2 id="maternal-bonds">MATERNAL BONDS</h2>

<p>The researchers did brain scans on <a href="##" title="madri alla prima esperienza">first-time mothers</a> before and after <a href="##" title="gravidanza">pregnancy</a>. They found that <a href="##" title="gravidanza">pregnancy</a> alters the size and structure of regions of the brain involved in understanding the thoughts, feelings, <a href="##" title="credenze">beliefs</a> and intentions of others. Two years after giving birth, the changes were so evident that a computer algorithm could use them to identify which women had been pregnant and which had not&hellip; However, a growing body of research is observing this type of plasticity in first-time fathers, too. They also experience the cognitive, physical and emotional demands of caring for a <a href="##" title="neonato">newborn</a>.  </p>
