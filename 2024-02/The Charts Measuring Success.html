<p>Dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, la musica popolare prese il sopravvento sulla radio, spinta dall&rsquo;emergere di un nuovo gruppo demografico e di consumatori: gli adolescenti. Le classifiche si trasformarono in rivelazioni di superstar.</p>

<p><a href="##" title="essere in cima">Topping</a> the <a href="##" title="classifica">charts</a> is the <a href="##" title="sacro graal">holy grail</a> for most recording artists, an indication of their popularity with the music-buying public. The first music chart appeared in 1913 in the US entertainment magazine Variety. At a time when recorded music was not yet available for sale and even radios were <a href="##" title="scarse">scarce</a>, this weekly chart was based on sales of <a href="##" title="spartiti">sheet music</a> in New York City. That same year, <a href="##" title="manifesto, cartello">Billboard</a> magazine published its own similar chart, and in 1936 it <a href="##" title="pubblicare">released</a> the first pop chart based on record sales. </p>

<h2 id="scandal">SCANDAL</h2>

<p>Early <a href="##" title="manifesto, cartello">Billboard</a> <a href="##" title="classifica">charts</a> also incorporated radio <a href="##" title="trasmissione via radio">airplay</a> as data. However, some corrupt record label executives <a href="##" title="corrompere">bribed</a> radio DJs to play their songs! This practice became known as a ‘payola’ — a <a href="##" title="parola composta">portmanteau</a> of ‘pay’ and Vitrola, the name of a popular record player. It was <a href="##" title="dichiarare fuori legge">outlawed</a> following an FBI investigation in the late 1950s.</p>

<h2 id="diamond-disc">DIAMOND DISC</h2>

<p>The UK did not release its own chart until 1952, when the editor of music magazine <a href="##" title="New Musical Express">NME</a> telephoned a few record shops to ask what songs were popular that week. The result, the UK’s Official Charts, was a massive success. As pop music boomed, the record industry also began to recognise their artists’ <a href="##" title="successi">achievements</a> with a system of certification. The first Gold Disc was presented in the US in 1958 to Perry Como for half-a-million sales of Catch A Falling Star. A UK Gold Disc is <a href="##" title="conferire">awarded</a> for a hundred thousand sales. Higher sales qualify for a Platinum or even a Diamond Disc. </p>

<h2 id="evolution">EVOLUTION</h2>

<p>Pop Music Chart Day is now celebrated every 4 January, and the USA’s <a href="##" title="manifesto, cartello">Billboard</a> Hot 100 (singles) and <a href="##" title="manifesto, cartello">Billboard</a> 200 (albums) remain the music industry’s best-known <a href="##" title="classifica">charts</a>. With the evolution of technology and the decline of physical sales, however, the <a href="##" title="classifica">charts</a> have changed. Now largely based on downloads and streaming, some songs <a href="##" title="restare">linger</a> for over a year, and old songs <a href="##" title="strozzare">strangle</a> the <a href="##" title="classifica">charts</a> at Christmas time! Ed Sheeran’s Perfect spent 191 weeks on the UK chart, and both Mariah Carey’s and Wham!’s Christmas tracks hit number one decades after their release. </p>

<h2 id="fair-play">FAIR PLAY</h2>

<p>This means that some artists <a href="##" title="non riuscirci">miss out</a> on being listed on the <a href="##" title="classifica">charts</a>, despite being popular. As a result, some countries are imposing new <a href="##" title="nome">rules</a>, including <a href="##" title="proibire">banning</a> songs more than eighteen months old from the <a href="##" title="classifica">charts</a>. In 2017, after an Ed Sheeran album release <a href="##" title="collocarsi">placed</a> nine of his tracks in the top ten singles chart, the UK changed its <a href="##" title="nome">rules</a>, allowing only three songs by an artist in the Top 100.  </p>

<h2 id="chart-records">CHART RECORDS</h2>

<p>US singer Elvis Presley holds the record in the UK <a href="##" title="classifica">charts</a> with twenty-one #1 hits, while The Beatles achieved nineteen in the US. Whitney Houston holds the record for the most consecutive US chart toppers, with seven, while Mariah Carey has spent ninety-one weeks in the top spot. Drake’s 431 weeks on the Hot 100 is by far the longest of any artist. </p>

<h2 id="defining-song">DEFINING SONG</h2>

<p>A 2019 viral social media post <a href="##" title="affermare">claimed</a> that the song that was No.1 on your 14th birthday defines your entire life. Is this true for you?
