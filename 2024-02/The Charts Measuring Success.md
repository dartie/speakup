# The Charts: Measuring Success   [B1]

Dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, la musica popolare prese il sopravvento sulla radio, spinta dall'emergere di un nuovo gruppo demografico e di consumatori: gli adolescenti. Le classifiche si trasformarono in rivelazioni di superstar.

[Topping](## "essere in cima") the [charts](## "classifica") is the [holy grail](## "sacro graal") for most recording artists, an indication of their popularity with the music-buying public. The first music chart appeared in 1913 in the US entertainment magazine Variety. At a time when recorded music was not yet available for sale and even radios were [scarce](## "scarse"), this weekly chart was based on sales of [sheet music](## "spartiti") in New York City. That same year, [Billboard](## "manifesto, cartello") magazine published its own similar chart, and in 1936 it [released](## "pubblicare") the first pop chart based on record sales. 

## SCANDAL
Early [Billboard](## "manifesto, cartello") [charts](## "classifica") also incorporated radio [airplay](## "trasmissione via radio") as data. However, some corrupt record label executives [bribed](## "corrompere") radio DJs to play their songs! This practice became known as a ‘payola’ — a [portmanteau](## "parola composta") of ‘pay’ and Vitrola, the name of a popular record player. It was [outlawed](## "dichiarare fuori legge") following an FBI investigation in the late 1950s.

## DIAMOND DISC
The UK did not release its own chart until 1952, when the editor of music magazine [NME](## "New Musical Express") telephoned a few record shops to ask what songs were popular that week. The result, the UK’s Official Charts, was a massive success. As pop music boomed, the record industry also began to recognise their artists’ [achievements](## "successi") with a system of certification. The first Gold Disc was presented in the US in 1958 to Perry Como for half-a-million sales of Catch A Falling Star. A UK Gold Disc is [awarded](## "conferire") for a hundred thousand sales. Higher sales qualify for a Platinum or even a Diamond Disc. 

## EVOLUTION
Pop Music Chart Day is now celebrated every 4 January, and the USA’s [Billboard](## "manifesto, cartello") Hot 100 (singles) and [Billboard](## "manifesto, cartello") 200 (albums) remain the music industry’s best-known [charts](## "classifica"). With the evolution of technology and the decline of physical sales, however, the [charts](## "classifica") have changed. Now largely based on downloads and streaming, some songs [linger](## "restare") for over a year, and old songs [strangle](## "strozzare") the [charts](## "classifica") at Christmas time! Ed Sheeran’s Perfect spent 191 weeks on the UK chart, and both Mariah Carey’s and Wham!’s Christmas tracks hit number one decades after their release. 

## FAIR PLAY
This means that some artists [miss out](## "non riuscirci") on being listed on the [charts](## "classifica"), despite being popular. As a result, some countries are imposing new [rules](## "nome"), including [banning](## "proibire") songs more than eighteen months old from the [charts](## "classifica"). In 2017, after an Ed Sheeran album release [placed](## "collocarsi") nine of his tracks in the top ten singles chart, the UK changed its [rules](## "nome"), allowing only three songs by an artist in the Top 100.  

## CHART RECORDS
US singer Elvis Presley holds the record in the UK [charts](## "classifica") with twenty-one #1 hits, while The Beatles achieved nineteen in the US. Whitney Houston holds the record for the most consecutive US chart toppers, with seven, while Mariah Carey has spent ninety-one weeks in the top spot. Drake’s 431 weeks on the Hot 100 is by far the longest of any artist. 

## DEFINING SONG
A 2019 viral social media post [claimed](## "affermare") that the song that was No.1 on your 14th birthday defines your entire life. Is this true for you?
