# Random Acts of Kindness   [B1]

Rendere felici gli altri non costa molto: un sorriso o un complimento possono migliorare la giornata di chiunque. Per questo, 30 anni fa è stata istituita una giornata per celebrare questi atti di altruismo.

Can you remember a time when someone held open a door for you? Or when someone let you jump the queue when you [were in a hurry](## "avere fretta")? Or when you [dropped](## "fare cadere") your bag on the street and a [passerby](## "passante") helped you [pick up](## "raccogliere") the contents? Such [random](## "fortuito") acts of kindness can [lift your mood](## "sollevare l’umore"), leaving you with a warm feeling that lasts all day.

## A DAY OF KINDNESS
There is a date in the US calendar on which such gestures are particularly encouraged. 17 February is known as Random Acts of Kindness Day. The initiative serves as a reminder that these small but [meaningful](## "significativi") acts have the power to change the world. The idea is to create a more compassionate and [caring](## "premuroso, attento") society, by [spreading](## "diffondere") love and positivity.

## THE START OF A MOVEMENT
It all started some forty years ago in the US, in the San Francisco Bay area. The phrase was [coined](## "coniare") by journalist Anne Herbert in 1982, who wrote about “[random](## "fortuito") acts of kindness and acts of [senseless](## "insensato") beauty.” Herbert could not have imagined that her ideas would [trigger](## "scatenare") a worldwide movement. The words were painted on walls, discussed in classrooms and written about in the media. [Slowly but surely](## "lentamente ma indubbiamente"), the message spread. 

## RAK DAY IS BORN
Herbert published an illustrated children’s book on the same theme in 1993. It was received with enthusiasm by children and adults [alike](## "allo stesso modo"). Local Random Acts of Kindness Days [grew into](## "trasformarsi in") an annual celebration in the US. While the first event was funded by the book’s publisher, Conari Press, a [nonprofit](## "senza scopo di lucro") foundation was created in 1995 to organise future celebrations. 

## RAKTIVISM
The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation is on a mission to make kindness the norm. Besides the celebration on 17 February — the same week as Valentine’s Day — it also provides free resources for schools, workplaces, homes and communities. It encourages people to become RAKtivists ([short for](## "abbreviazione di") Random Acts of Kindness activists), who turn ordinary days into something special with small, [thoughtful](## "premurosi") gestures — like a bright smile or offering a seat on the bus. 

## KINDNESS AS A WAY OF LIFE
The movement gets bigger every year. Influencers share content on social media. Celebrities are judged by how kind they are to others. Corporates are [eager](## "desiderosi")[to join in](## "unirsi a"). Last year, Krispy Kreme gave out free doughnuts. It has now spread to New Zealand, where it is observed on 1 September. The ultimate goal is to make it a way of life. The foundation is hopeful: “Together, we can make the world a better place, [one act of kindness at a time](## "uno alla volta").”
