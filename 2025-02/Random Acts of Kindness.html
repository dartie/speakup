<p>Rendere felici gli altri non costa molto: un sorriso o un complimento possono migliorare la giornata di chiunque. Per questo, 30 anni fa è stata istituita una giornata per celebrare questi atti di altruismo.</p>

<p>Can you remember a time when someone held open a door for you? Or when someone let you jump the queue when you <a href="##" title="avere fretta">were in a hurry</a>? Or when you <a href="##" title="fare cadere">dropped</a> your bag on the street and a <a href="##" title="passante">passerby</a> helped you <a href="##" title="raccogliere">pick up</a> the contents? Such <a href="##" title="fortuito">random</a> acts of kindness can <a href="##" title="sollevare l’umore">lift your mood</a>, leaving you with a warm feeling that lasts all day.</p>

<h2 id="a-day-of-kindness">A DAY OF KINDNESS</h2>

<p>There is a date in the US calendar on which such gestures are particularly encouraged. 17 February is known as Random Acts of Kindness Day. The initiative serves as a reminder that these small but <a href="##" title="significativi">meaningful</a> acts have the power to change the world. The idea is to create a more compassionate and <a href="##" title="premuroso, attento">caring</a> society, by <a href="##" title="diffondere">spreading</a> love and positivity.</p>

<h2 id="the-start-of-a-movement">THE START OF A MOVEMENT</h2>

<p>It all started some forty years ago in the US, in the San Francisco Bay area. The phrase was <a href="##" title="coniare">coined</a> by journalist Anne Herbert in 1982, who wrote about “<a href="##" title="fortuito">random</a> acts of kindness and acts of <a href="##" title="insensato">senseless</a> beauty.” Herbert could not have imagined that her ideas would <a href="##" title="scatenare">trigger</a> a worldwide movement. The words were painted on walls, discussed in classrooms and written about in the media. <a href="##" title="lentamente ma indubbiamente">Slowly but surely</a>, the message spread. </p>

<h2 id="rak-day-is-born">RAK DAY IS BORN</h2>

<p>Herbert published an illustrated children’s book on the same theme in 1993. It was received with enthusiasm by children and adults <a href="##" title="allo stesso modo">alike</a>. Local Random Acts of Kindness Days <a href="##" title="trasformarsi in">grew into</a> an annual celebration in the US. While the first event was funded by the book’s publisher, Conari Press, a <a href="##" title="senza scopo di lucro">nonprofit</a> foundation was created in 1995 to organise future celebrations. </p>

<h2 id="raktivism">RAKTIVISM</h2>

<p>The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation is on a mission to make kindness the norm. Besides the celebration on 17 February — the same week as Valentine’s Day — it also provides free resources for schools, workplaces, homes and communities. It encourages people to become RAKtivists (<a href="##" title="abbreviazione di">short for</a> Random Acts of Kindness activists), who turn ordinary days into something special with small, <a href="##" title="premurosi">thoughtful</a> gestures — like a bright smile or offering a seat on the bus. </p>

<h2 id="kindness-as-a-way-of-life">KINDNESS AS A WAY OF LIFE</h2>

<p>The movement gets bigger every year. Influencers share content on social media. Celebrities are judged by how kind they are to others. Corporates are <a href="##" title="desiderosi">eager</a><a href="##" title="unirsi a">to join in</a>. Last year, Krispy Kreme gave out free doughnuts. It has now spread to New Zealand, where it is observed on 1 September. The ultimate goal is to make it a way of life. The foundation is hopeful: “Together, we can make the world a better place, <a href="##" title="uno alla volta">one act of kindness at a time</a>.”  </p>
