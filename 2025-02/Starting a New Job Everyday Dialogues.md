Marc: Hi, I’m here for the onboarding.
Laura: Welcome to the group! Did you [manage](## "farcela") to read the employee handbook?
Marc: Yes, and I got the welcome package, too. Thank you so much!
Laura: Haha, everyone loves the company merchandise! Have you familiarised yourself with the company [policies](## "politica")?
Marc: Yes, I have. There was a lot to go [through](## "ripassare, vedere")!
Laura: I know, but it’s important you know them all. Here is a copy of your job description.
Marc: Thanks. I got it via email, too.
Laura: And here is your login for the intranet. You can change the password to something more personal.
Marc: I’ll do that as soon as I’ve settled into my [workstation](## "postazione di lavoro").
Laura: Excellent. Your co-worker will explain how everything works and your line [manage](## "farcela")r will [take you [through](## "ripassare, vedere")](## "guidare") the [training](## "formazione") programme.  Any questions?
Marc: Oh, plenty! But first I’d like to meet my colleagues.
Laura: Of course! We have [arranged](## "organizzare") a lovely team lunch, so you can get to know each other. Let’s go!

## NOW  LET’S  REVIEW  THE  VOCABULARY!
Onboarding is the process of integrating a new employee into an organisation.
An employee handbook is a manual that details the company’s [policies](## "politica"), procedures and values.
A welcome package contains materials and information for new employees, to help them feel welcome and comfortable, as they [settle into](## "adattarsi") their new role.
Merchandise refers to [branded](## "di marca") promotional [goods](## "prodotti"), like T-shirts, [mugs](## "tazze") and pens.
A company policy establishes a set of rules and expectations. Typical [policies](## "politica") include code of conduct, health & safety, [compensation](## "retribuzione"), equal opportunities, and [attendance](## "presenza").
A login is a password or code used when [logging in](## "fare l’accesso")
An intranet is a private network used within a company to share information and computing [resources](## "risorse") like software and communication [tools](## "strumenti").
To [settle into](## "adattarsi") means to start to feel comfortable in a new situation.
A line [manage](## "farcela")r is a person who directly [manage](## "farcela")s a team or department and its day-to-day operations.
Plenty means more than enough.
A team lunch is a [midday meal](## "pasto di mezzogiorno") with colleagues, where everyone can relax and [strengthen](## "rafforzare") relationships.
