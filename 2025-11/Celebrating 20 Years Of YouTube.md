It was Valentine’s Day 2005 when three ex-Paypal employees, Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim, founded YouTube. The world quickly fell in love with the platform, and just over a year later, Google acquired it for $1.65 billion. 

## FIVE BILLION VIDEOS
Headquartered in San Bruno, Ca, YouTube is now the world’s second-most-visited website, after Google Search. It has [over five billion](## "oltre cinque miliardi") videos, in almost every imaginable category, and about 2.5 billion users, who collectively watch more than one billion hours of video a day. 
Today, the video-sharing platform has considerable power over what many believe to be the truth. As its influence over popular culture and global trends has grown, so have concerns over its content [policies](## "politiche, norme"), copyright issues and [handling](## "trattamento, gestione") of misinformation and [harmful](## "nocivo, pericoloso") content. [Despite](## "nonostante ciò") this, YouTube looks like it is here to stay! As the platform celebrates its 20th anniversary, we take a look at five of its most famous viral videos.

## 1. “ME AT THE ZOO”
This was the first YouTube video ever! Uploaded on 23 April 2005, the nineteen-second video shows YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim standing in front of two elephants at the San Diego Zoo in California, talking about the length of their [trunks](## "proboscidi"). It’s had over 360 million views.

## 2. “LAZY SUNDAY”
This music video by the US comedy [troupe](## "compagnia") The Lonely Island debuted on Saturday Night Live on 17 December 2005 and was immediately uploaded by fans onto YouTube. It showed the [troupe](## "compagnia") rapping about cupcakes and cinema snacks, and is considered the first YouTube video to go viral. 

## 3. “FRIDAY”
In 2011, Rebecca Black, thirteen, became famous after the music video for her song Friday went viral — but for all the wrong reasons. Many described it as the worst song ever, and the video is now one of the most disliked in YouTube history. [Despite](## "nonostante ciò") this, Black went on to have a successful music career and even appeared in Katy Perry’s video for her song Last Friday Night ([T.G.I.F.](## "sigla di Thank God it’s Friday")) 

## 4. “BABY SHARK”
Who can forget the chorus for the children’s song Baby Shark (Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo)?! First uploaded onto YouTube by the South Korean entertainment company Pinkfong in 2015, the video for a remixed version went viral after it was uploaded a year later. It is now the most-viewed YouTube video of all time, with over 15.8 billion views.

## 5. “I’M NOT A CAT”
Perhaps the funniest video from the pandemic era was of Texas [attorney](## "avvocato") Rod Ponton appearing at a virtual [court hearing](## "udienza in tribunale") while [inadvertently](## "inavvertitamente") using a Zoom filter that made him look like a gray cat with sad eyes. “I’m here live,” Ponton says in the video. “I’m not a cat.” Reflecting on his viral fame this year, Ponton told The New York Times “It did let everybody have a moment of humour and a moment of [sanity](## "normalità") during the dark days of the pandemic. I’m glad it happened, even [at my expense](## "a mie spese").”
