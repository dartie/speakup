Daniel: Hey, I was thinking we could do something [meaningful](## "importante, significativo") as a team. How about a charity drive?
Anna: That’s a great idea! What cause did you have in mind?
Daniel: How about the food bank [down the road](## "in fondo alla strada")?
Anna: Sounds perfect. Do you know what kind of donations they accept?
Daniel: Tinned food and other non-perishable items, but also clothes and toys. We could collect things over the next two weeks.
Anna: OK, let’s do it! Who should we talk to about making it official?
Daniel: Probably the office manager. She’ll know how to get permission and spread the word.
Anna: OK, I’ll speak to her this afternoon, but let’s start planning now. Should we [set up](## "disporre, allestire") collection boxes around the office?
Daniel: Yes. One on each floor would be ideal. We’ll need to communicate it — maybe an announcement via email.
Anna: Do you want me to draft the email?
Daniel: That would be great. And let’s keep track of donations so we can share the results with our colleagues.
Anna: Definitely. It’ll be a great team-building exercise!
