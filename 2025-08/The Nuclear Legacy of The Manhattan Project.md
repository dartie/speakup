# The Nuclear Legacy of The Manhattan Project   [B2]

Tra il 1942 e il 1946, circa 600.000 persone contribuirono alla creazione di un’arma di distruzione di massa. Il Manhattan Project National Historical Park ne racconta l’intera storia.

Around $2.2 billion — about $24 billion in today’s currency — was [channelled into](## "destinare a") the Manhattan Project, a huge research and development project that produced the world’s first nuclear weapons in 1945. It centred on three main production sites: Los Alamos, New Mexico; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Hanford, Washington. Around each, secret communities [sprang up](## "sorgere, spuntare") that evolved into today’s cities of Los Alamos, Oak Ridge and the Tri-Cities, the collective name given to Kennewick, Pasco and Richland in Washington. Today, they all form part of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, established in 2015 to “improve understanding of the Manhattan Project and its legacy.”

## ATOMIC SCIENCE 
In fact, the Manhattan Project has multiple legacies, each as complex as the technology it developed. Immense wartime investment in scientific research led to the establishment of a network of National Laboratories in the US, which serve as the country’s leading institutions for scientific innovation. World War Two ended with the atomic bombings of Japan. However, in 1949 the Soviet Union’s successful testing of an atomic weapon brought on a forty-year Cold War and a nuclear arms race. Advancements in nuclear science and medicine brought with them [radioactive waste](## "rifiuti radioattivi") and accompanying [health hazards](## "rischi per la salute"). 

## NATIONAL LABS
Today, the seventeen National Laboratories [run](## "gestire, dirigere") by the US Department of Energy dedicate themselves to critical issues, including investigating clean technology to combat the climate crisis. While the labs are [fenced off](## "recintare"), you can [roam](## "vagare per, passeggiare") the surrounding rural and urban areas and learn about the project that made their work possible. 
The three sites of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park offer a range of visitor experiences, including tours led by a ranger or self-guided through the National Park Service (NPS) app. They tell stories of scientific [breakthroughs](## "scoperte, innovazioni") and human endeavour, but also explore the serious [ethical issues](## "questioni etiche") that [arose out of](## "sorgere da") a project that changed our world.
