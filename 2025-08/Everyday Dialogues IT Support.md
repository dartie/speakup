Bridget: Oh no, my computer’s playing up again.
Mark: What’s happening?
Bridget: [Whenever](## "ogni volta") I work in this file, it keeps freezing.
Mark: That sounds serious. You need to get that looked at.
Bridget: How do I reach tech support?
Mark: Through the intranet. You need to issue a support request.
Bridget: OK, and then what?
Mark: Then the [IT department](## "reparto informatico") raises a ticket and gets someone assigned to your case.
Bridget: How long does that take?
Mark: It all depends on what priority it gets, but they’re usually pretty quick.
Bridget: Oh, good. Now can you talk me through the process of sending the request?
Mark: Sure, let’s do that now.
