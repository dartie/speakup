American football is known for causing debilitating head injuries, mostly from players [tackling](## "placcare") each other — an unfortunate [trend](## "tendenza") that inspired the 2015 biographical sports drama [Concussion](## "commozione cerebrale"), starring Will Smith. Perhaps this is why the non-contact version of American football, [flag](## "bandiera") football, has become so popular in recent years. Growing in popularity worldwide, [flag](## "bandiera") football is to make its debut at the next Olympics, which take place in Los Angeles, California in the summer of 2028.

## A LOT LESS CONTACT
In [flag](## "bandiera") football, just like in American football, two teams compete to score points by moving the ball down the field, into the other team’s end zone. However, [unlike](## "al contrario") in American football, in [flag](## "bandiera") football the players wear [flag](## "bandiera")s on their [waist](## "vita, cintura") and instead of [tackling](## "placcare") each other, they try to pull the [flag](## "bandiera") of the player with the ball to stop them. So while American football is a high-impact contact sport, the contact between players in [flag](## "bandiera") football is very limited, and so the risk of injury is significantly reduced.

## WORLD WAR TWO
Flag football was originally played on US military bases during World War Two. Originally known as touch and [tail](## "coda") football, it began as a recreational sport for army personnel as a means to remain active while not risking the injuries associated with American football. The first known game of [flag](## "bandiera") football was at Fort Meade in Maryland, which is now considered the [birthplace](## "luogo di nascita") of the sport.

## GLOBAL REACH
After the war, [flag](## "bandiera") football continued to be played on US military bases and soon [caught on](## "prendere piede") among civilians living across the US. The National Flag Football Association was formed in 1971 to govern the sport in the US. And the International Federation of American Football (IFAF) [oversees](## "supervisionare") the sport internationally since 2002. 

## OLYMPIC SPORT
According to the IFAF, [flag](## "bandiera") football is played by more than twenty million people in more than one hundred countries and will soon become more popular than American football. The sport debuted at the 2022 World Games, an international multi-sport competition including non-Olympic sports, and will be played at this summer’s World Games in Chengdu, China. Both male and female teams will compete for the first time at the 2028 Olympics and [flag](## "bandiera") football will be introduced to millions more sports fans, contributing to its popularity.
