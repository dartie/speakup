<p>The <a href="##" title="ascensore">lift</a> was broken again! Angrily I <a href="##" title="salire con sforzo">struggled up</a> to the eighth floor with my bags of shopping. The <a href="##" title="tromba delle scale">stairwell</a> <a href="##" title="puzzare">stank</a> of <a href="##" title="stantio, rancido">stale</a> cooking odours, probably urine and something like burnt plastic. I really had to find a new flat, but it would be hard to get something as cheap in this part of town.
“Look at you, darlink, sweating like a pig. You need more exercise!” My Romanian neighbour Mrs. Popescu <a href="##" title="sorridere">grinned</a> at me from her <a href="##" title="soglia d’ingresso">doorway,</a> her huge body <a href="##" title="avvolgere">wrapped</a> in one of her flowered <a href="##" title="vestaglie">negligees</a>.
“Oh <a href="##" title="levati dai piedi">bugger off</a>,  Ylenia!”  Mrs. Popescu was the only neighbour I knew. Enormously <a href="##" title="sovrappeso">overweight</a>, with a dry sense of humour, she particularly enjoyed laughing at me. But she was a warm, friendly person who always called me ‘darlink’. I only ever saw her in extravagant <a href="##" title="vestaglie">negligees</a> and I had an idea she’d once been famous in her own country; I’d seen some photos on a <a href="##" title="scaffale">shelf</a> of a much younger, <a href="##" title="più snella">slimmer</a> Mrs. Popescu in a <a href="##" title="scintillante">glittery</a> tutu. 
“What is that smell?” I said, <a href="##" title="aprire una serratura">unlocking</a> my door.
“I don’t know, darlink. The <a href="##" title="ascensore">lift</a> broke. I think somebody die in there.”
“It smells like burnt plastic!”
“Maybe it’s vampires! Ha ha ha!” She laughed, then turned gracefully and went back into her flat.
I was <a href="##" title="svegliare">woken</a> <a href="##" title="a notte fonda">in the dead of night</a> by the sound of breaking glass. I heard shouting on the stairs; then I smelled smoke. Still in my pyjamas, I threw open the door. The <a href="##" title="tromba delle scale">stairwell</a> was full of dark, <a href="##" title="asfissianti">choking</a> fumes. It was impossible to go down. Without stopping to think, I ran up the last two <a href="##" title="rampe di scale">flights of stairs</a> to the roof. If anything, the smoke was worse. “Heat rises!” I thought <a href="##" title="amaramente">bitterly</a>. 
I knew there was a fire escape somewhere but in the dark smokey air I couldn’t see it, so I <a href="##" title="affacciarsi">leaned out</a> over the <a href="##" title="parapetto">parapet</a>, searching. A thin iron <a href="##" title="trave">girder</a> <a href="##" title="estendersi">stretched</a> from my roof to another building, a distance of about six metres. It supported a <a href="##" title="corda">rope</a> of cables and wires, but was far too narrow to walk on and the pavement below was at least a twenty-metre drop. Had this been a film, I would have <a href="##" title="fare l’equilibrista">swung across</a> the iron <a href="##" title="trave">girder</a> hand over hand like a monkey. In real life, of course, I wasn’t athletic enough to get half way.
“Those stairs, darlink!” Mrs. Popescu <a href="##" title="tossire">coughed</a> and <a href="##" title="dare colpetti">patted</a> her chest. Incredibly, my <a href="##" title="tonda, grassoccia">round</a> Romanian neighbour was leaning against the <a href="##" title="parapetto">parapet</a>, still wearing her negligee and a pair of pink <a href="##" title="pantofole">slippers</a>. She was breathing heavily and, for some reason, holding a <a href="##" title="malridotto">battered</a> old umbrella. I’m <a href="##" title="pieno di vergogna">ashamed</a>, now, of my first thought: of all the people in the world, the <a href="##" title="sovrappeso">overweight</a>, unfit Mrs. Popescu was not the person I wanted to spend my last moments with. If I found the fire escape, she would only <a href="##" title="trattenere">hold me up</a>.
“Fire escape no good,” she said, reading my thoughts. “Probably <a href="##" title="sciogliersi">melted</a>. Downstairs all fire now. That’s the only way.”
My eyes were <a href="##" title="scorrere (lacrime)">streaming</a> in the smoke. “Where? <a href="##" title="da che parte?">Which way</a>?”
She <a href="##" title="annuire">nodded</a> at the narrow iron <a href="##" title="trave">girder</a>. “<a href="##" title="aiutami a salire sul muro">Help me onto the wall</a>.”
“You’re joking!”
“No, it’s easy,” she insisted. “I used to do it all the time.” She <a href="##" title="sollevare">heaved</a> herself onto the <a href="##" title="parapetto">parapet</a>, opened the umbrella and <a href="##" title="tenere">held</a> it high above her. Then, to my <a href="##" title="stupore">amazement</a>, she performed a slow, precise pirouette. Her movements were graceful, her feet surprisingly tiny and delicate. 
The idea was still ridiculous. “You’ll never make it, you’re too…”
“Fat?” she asked, smiling. “It’s the steroids.”
“The what?” 
“The steroids. They  <a href="##" title="imbottire (di farmaci)">pumped</a> me full of them when I train as young gymnast in Romania. That’s why I never grow very tall.” She sighed. “I had hopes of Olympic medal, but then I have accident and that was the end of that.”
It was getting difficult to breathe. She went on. “After that it was the circus. The <a href="##" title="fune">tight<a href="##" title="corda">rope</a></a>! I was Ylenia, Queen of the Sky for twenty years.” </p>

<p>Light as a <a href="##" title="piuma">feather</a>, she <a href="##" title="fece un passo di danza con salto">chasséd</a> along the perimeter wall to where the iron <a href="##" title="trave">girder</a> <a href="##" title="estendersi">stretched</a> across to the other roof. One hand <a href="##" title="tenere">held</a> the umbrella, the other she <a href="##" title="tendere">reached out</a> to me. 
“Well? You coming or not?” 
I could hear the flames <a href="##" title="ruggire, rombare">roaring</a> now and, far below, a chorus of sirens. There was no way the firefighters could get to us in time. And yet, <a href="##" title="malgrado">despite</a> the imminent danger, <a href="##" title="non riuscivo a impormi di saltare sopra (la trave)">I couldn’t force myself out onto</a> the <a href="##" title="trave">girder</a>.
She smiled. “You’re going to be toast!” Turning her back on me, she began to walk along the <a href="##" title="trave">girder</a>, placing her delicate feet one after the other at a <a href="##" title="leggero">slight</a> angle. She was so <a href="##" title="stabile">steady</a>; only her thin negligee <a href="##" title="agitarsi">flapped</a> <a href="##" title="leggero">slight</a>ly, revealing her huge legs. <a href="##" title="brillare">Glowing</a> in the orangey light of the fire, she looked suddenly beautiful and magnificent, like an angel, and I understood that she really was going to save me.
“Wait!” I cried out.
Slowly, she performed another perfect pirouette, then <a href="##" title="fare un passo">stepped</a> quickly back to where I stood shaking. 
The smoke was burning my eyes and <a href="##" title="gola">throat</a>. “Help me!” Ylenia <a href="##" title="annuire">nodded</a> encouragingly and <a href="##" title="tenere">held</a> out her hand. With the blood <a href="##" title="ruggire, rombare">roaring</a> in my ears louder than the flames, I <a href="##" title="afferrare">grasped</a> her fingers and followed her out over the edge to safety.</p>
