<p>At the time of its invasion by the Roman Empire in 43 <a href="##" title="d.C. (Anno Domini)">AD</a>, Britain was a <a href="##" title="coacervo">patchwork</a> of territories dominated by various tribes. A number of tribal leaders retained their power, becoming client kings of Emperor Claudius, paying <a href="##" title="tasse">taxes</a> to Rome and allowing the military access to their land. As the new Roman occupation expanded in Britain, many of these members of the native aristocracy were influenced by Roman culture: they owned Roman <a href="##" title="beni, prodotti">goods</a>, adopted Roman habits, and sometimes even sent their sons to Rome to be educated. </p>

<h2 id="betrayal">betrayal</h2>

<p>One such tribal leader was Prasutagus, chief of the Iceni tribe of Norfolk in the east of England. Under Emperor Claudius’s rule the Iceni <a href="##" title="considerarsi">regarded themselves</a> as <a href="##" title="alleati">allies</a> of Rome, but by the time of Prasutagus’s death, Emperor Nero <a href="##" title="governare">ruled</a> the Roman Empire, and things changed. Prasutagus was wealthy and in his <a href="##" title="testamento">will</a> he left half of his <a href="##" title="patrimonio">estate</a> to Nero and the other half to his two daughters. Nero was <a href="##" title="contrariato">displeased</a> by this. Assuming the Iceni were an easy target, he ordered the Roman army to attack the tribe and <a href="##" title="saccheggiare">plunder</a> their land. </p>

<h2 id="revenge">REVENGE</h2>

<p>Prasutagus’ <a href="##" title="vedova">widow</a> Boudica was czzzrowned queen after her husband’s death. While she tried to resist the Roman attack, her possessions and those of the Iceni tribe were <a href="##" title="impossessarsi">seized</a> by the soldiers; Boudica was publically <a href="##" title="percuotere">beaten</a>, and her daughters <a href="##" title="violentare">raped</a>. <a href="##" title="fare infuriare">Enraged</a> by this humiliation, Boudica <a href="##" title="radunare">rallied</a> an army of 120,000 soldiers from different Briton tribes. They <a href="##" title="dirigersi">headed</a> to Camulodunum (present-day Colchester), a former tribal capital and a symbol of Roman power in Britain, which in 60 <a href="##" title="d.C. (Anno Domini)">AD</a> was a quiet, poorly-defended town where army veterans and their families lived. Boudica’s army destroyed it and <a href="##" title="massacrare">slaughtered</a> its population. </p>

<h2 id="final-battle">FINAL BATTLE</h2>

<p>Boudica then attacked Londinium (present-day London), which had been founded as a <a href="##" title="porto commerciale">trading port</a> for bringing people and <a href="##" title="beni, prodotti">goods</a> into Britannia, and had a population of around nine thousand people. After destroying the <a href="##" title="insediamento">settlement</a>, the Britons <a href="##" title="dirigersi">headed</a> north west to Verulamium (present-day St. Albans). By the time its work was done, some seventy thousand Roman citizens had been killed. In 61 <a href="##" title="d.C. (Anno Domini)">AD</a>, however, Roman forces finally <a href="##" title="sconfiggere">defeated</a> Boudica’s army. In a battle that took place in an unknown location, possibly in the English Midlands, an estimated eighty thousand Britons were killed, while Roman <a href="##" title="vittime">casualties</a><strong> </strong><a href="##" title="giungere a">amounted to</a> just four hundred. </p>

<h2 id="uncertain-fate-destino">uncertain <a href="##" title="destino">fate</a></h2>

<p>Boudica’s <a href="##" title="destino">fate</a> is <a href="##" title="mettere in dubbio">contested</a>: some <a href="##" title="racconti">accounts</a> <a href="##" title="affermare">claim</a> she killed herself by drinking poison, others that she died after an illness, and was given an elaborate <a href="##" title="sepoltura">burial</a>. <a href="##" title="in qualsiasi modo">Either way</a>, she remained a minor historical figure until the 16th century, when favourable comparisons were made between Elizabeth I and the ancient Iceni warrior. A speech Elizabeth I reportedly gave to her army at Tilbury before the battle against the invading Spanish Armada has some resemblance to a speech given by Boudica that was documented by the Roman historian Tacitus. </p>

<h2 id="victorious">VICTORIOUS</h2>

<p>Under Elizabeth I’s successor, James I, Boudica once again <a href="##" title="cadere in disgrazia">fell out of favour</a>. Her reputation, however, was revived during the reign of Queen Victoria. The 19th-century queen who presided over the expansion of the British Empire <a href="##" title="potrebbe">may well</a> have felt some connection with the heroic defender of Britain. Coincidentally, the women had similar names, too: Boudica can be translated as ‘victory’. In 1902 Boudica and her daughters were immortalised in a dynamic bronze statue that stands on London’s Westminster Bridge near the Houses of Parliament.
