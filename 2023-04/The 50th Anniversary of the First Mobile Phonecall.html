<p>Mezzo secolo fa un ingegnere della Motorola fece una chiamata usando un prototipo di telefono portatile, il primo del suo genere. Adesso non possiamo più farne a meno: per parlare, mandare messaggi, vedere film, trovare indirizzi, lavorare&hellip; per non parlare dell’uso delle reti sociali.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, an event <a href="##" title="aver luogo, succedere">took place</a> that would transform the way we live. On 3 April 1973, the very first mobile phone call was made, <a href="##" title="annunciare">heralding</a> a new era of global, continuous connectivity. Motorola engineer Martin ‘Marty’ Cooper was walking on New York’s Sixth Avenue when he called rival inventor Jo- el Engel of Bell Laboratories at AT&amp;T. He informed Engel that he was calling from a <a href="##" title="portatile">portable</a> telephone. Engel responded with silence, but history was made.</p>

<h2 id="shoebox-phone">SHOEBOX PHONE</h2>

<p>At the time, car phones already existed, but were <a href="##" title="alimentare">powered</a> by heavy equipment that had to be <a href="##" title="riporre, conservare">stored</a> in the <a href="##" title="bagagliaio">boot</a>. This mobile prototype, named the DynaTAC (short for ‘dynamic <a href="##" title="adattabile">adaptive</a> total area coverage’), could be <a href="##" title="portare in giro">carried around</a> but was still the size of a shoebox. It only had a half-hour battery life, and it took ten hours to charge. However, the press enthusiastically reported about a new concept of a “<a href="##" title="portatile">take-along</a> phone”; for the first time, phone calls were <a href="##" title="legare">tied</a> to a person, not a place or a car.</p>

<h2 id="yuppie-gadget">YUPPIE GADGET</h2>

<p>Marty Cooper and his team worked for years to reduce the phone’s size. Finally, in 1983, the world’s first commercially-available <a href="##" title="portatile, tascabile">handheld</a> mobile phone was released. The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X was 25cm tall, without the antenna, <a href="##" title="pesare">weighed</a> 790g and cost $3,995. It became the ultimate yuppie (young urban professional) accessory, a symbol of wealth but also of gratuitous <a href="##" title="spesa, acquisto">spending</a>.</p>

<h2 id="popularity">POPULARITY</h2>

<p>In just fifty years, however, Cooper’s invention has revolutionised our world. The cell phone is no longer considered a status symbol, it is a necessity. Smartphones, introduced in 1993, became ubiquitous by the 2000s. Since then, phones have become <a href="##" title="più sottili">slimmer</a>, lighter and more powerful, and can cost from <span class="math inline">\(50 to \)</span>1,500 for the latest iPhone. According to recent statistics, the <a href="##" title="attuale">current</a> number of cell phone owners is 7.33 billion, over 91 per cent of the world’s population; 66 per cent own a smartphone. </p>

<h2 id="tech-pioneer">TECH PIONEER</h2>

<p>Cooper worked for Motorola for twenty-nine years, contributing to significant inventions, including <a href="##" title="cercapersone">pagers</a> and two-way radio <a href="##" title="messaggio, comunicazione">dispatch</a> systems. He set up several businesses with his wife, Arlene Harris, also a <a href="##" title="senza cavo">wireless</a> tech inventor. Now, at ninety-four, he still <a href="##" title="esser membro di un comitato">sits on several committees</a> in the industry. <a href="##" title="anche se">Despite</a> cell phones’ reported negative effects on mental health, Cooper considers them a good thing for humanity. He believes they can improve healthcare and even eradicate poverty. As he told CBS News: “We are only at the very, very beginning. I know I sound like an optimist, but poverty is going to be a thing of the past.” A movie based on his autobiography Cutting the <a href="##" title="cavo">Cord</a> is <a href="##" title="attuale">current</a>ly in production.</p>
