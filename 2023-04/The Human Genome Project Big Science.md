# The Human Genome Project: Big Science   [B1]

Questa iniziativa di collaborazione scientifica internazionale venne portata a termine vent’anni fa: un progetto senza precedenti nell’ambito della ricerca medica, con un metodo innovativo e multidisciplinare che aprì un universo di possibilità per combattere le malattie genetiche.

Deoxyribonucleic acid, or [DNA](## "acido desossiribonucleico"), is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. It was first [isolated](## "isolare") in 1869. However, it took over a century of development before the field of genomics — the study of genes and their functions — was to transform science and medicine. 

## ORIGINS
In 1984, Italian-American virologist Renato Dulbecco suggested that given the advancements in genomics, knowing and ordering (or ‘sequencing’) the human genome — a human being’s complete set of [DNA](## "acido desossiribonucleico") — would help understand cancer, the most common human genetic disease. Dulbecco, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1975, was more ambitious than many biologists; they [argued](## "sostenere") that [channelling](## "destinare") resources to one big science project was risky and [unfair](## "ingiusto") to small research units, the usual way of doing science [up until then](## "fino a quel momento"). In 1988, however, the US National Academy of Science committee report [endorsed](## "appoggiare, sostenere") the project, and [funding](## "finanziamento") to start a three-billion-dollar, fifteen-year programme was received. 

## PROCESS
The Human Genome Project officially began in October 1990. It was the largest international collaboration ever [undertaken](## "intraprendere") in biology. Thousands of scientists working in multiple centres across the US, China, Japan, France, Germany and the UK [teamed up](## "formare una squadra"). It was decided to sequence the smaller genomes first, such as mouse, [worm](## "verme") and fruit fly (all with significant gene similarities to human), before [taking on](## "affrontare") the [challenging](## "impegnativo") human genome. On 14 April 2003, the Human Genome Project was declared completed.

## RESULTS
Dulbecco died in 2012, but he lived to see his idea transform cancer research, as well as that of other genetic illnesses: from cystic fibrosis, resulting from mutations in a single gene, to Alzheimer’s, where many genes are [involved](## "coinvolgere"). It helped doctors identify hereditary mutations and led to the development of new technologies and tools for testing and analysis. 
[What’s more](## "inoltre") the Human Genome Project marked a whole new [approach](## "approccio") to science that was to be crucial in combatting the Covid pandemic. Combining the expertise of biologists, engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians, it established an open [approach](## "approccio") to data sharing and [open-source software](## "software con codice aperto"), making the project’s [findings](## "scoperte") accessible to everyone.

## THE FUTURE
New initiatives have been set up to [fine-tune](## "affinare") the sequencing process, and significant advancements have been made in [targeted](## "mirare") and personalised treatments. In 2020, the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was [awarded](## "assegnare") to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier for their work in genome editing. They developed a technique known as CRISPR/Cas9 that can repair errors in the [DNA](## "acido desossiribonucleico") itself. This type of research was made possible by the Human Genome Project.
