At the time of its invasion by the Roman Empire in 43 [AD](## "d.C. (Anno Domini)"), Britain was a [patchwork](## "coacervo") of territories dominated by various tribes. A number of tribal leaders retained their power, becoming client kings of Emperor Claudius, paying [taxes](## "tasse") to Rome and allowing the military access to their land. As the new Roman occupation expanded in Britain, many of these members of the native aristocracy were influenced by Roman culture: they owned Roman [goods](## "beni, prodotti"), adopted Roman habits, and sometimes even sent their sons to Rome to be educated. 

## betrayal
One such tribal leader was Prasutagus, chief of the Iceni tribe of Norfolk in the east of England. Under Emperor Claudius’s rule the Iceni [regarded themselves](## "considerarsi") as [allies](## "alleati") of Rome, but by the time of Prasutagus’s death, Emperor Nero [ruled](## "governare") the Roman Empire, and things changed. Prasutagus was wealthy and in his [will](## "testamento") he left half of his [estate](## "patrimonio") to Nero and the other half to his two daughters. Nero was [displeased](## "contrariato") by this. Assuming the Iceni were an easy target, he ordered the Roman army to attack the tribe and [plunder](## "saccheggiare") their land. 

## REVENGE
Prasutagus’ [widow](## "vedova") Boudica was czzzrowned queen after her husband’s death. While she tried to resist the Roman attack, her possessions and those of the Iceni tribe were [seized](## "impossessarsi") by the soldiers; Boudica was publically [beaten](## "percuotere"), and her daughters [raped](## "violentare"). [Enraged](## "fare infuriare") by this humiliation, Boudica [rallied](## "radunare") an army of 120,000 soldiers from different Briton tribes. They [headed](## "dirigersi") to Camulodunum (present-day Colchester), a former tribal capital and a symbol of Roman power in Britain, which in 60 [AD](## "d.C. (Anno Domini)") was a quiet, poorly-defended town where army veterans and their families lived. Boudica’s army destroyed it and [slaughtered](## "massacrare") its population. 

## FINAL BATTLE
Boudica then attacked Londinium (present-day London), which had been founded as a [trading port](## "porto commerciale") for bringing people and [goods](## "beni, prodotti") into Britannia, and had a population of around nine thousand people. After destroying the [settlement](## "insediamento"), the Britons [headed](## "dirigersi") north west to Verulamium (present-day St. Albans). By the time its work was done, some seventy thousand Roman citizens had been killed. In 61 [AD](## "d.C. (Anno Domini)"), however, Roman forces finally [defeated](## "sconfiggere") Boudica’s army. In a battle that took place in an unknown location, possibly in the English Midlands, an estimated eighty thousand Britons were killed, while Roman [casualties](## "vittime")** **[amounted to](## "giungere a") just four hundred. 

## uncertain [fate](## "destino")
Boudica’s [fate](## "destino") is [contested](## "mettere in dubbio"): some [accounts](## "racconti") [claim](## "affermare") she killed herself by drinking poison, others that she died after an illness, and was given an elaborate [burial](## "sepoltura"). [Either way](## "in qualsiasi modo"), she remained a minor historical figure until the 16th century, when favourable comparisons were made between Elizabeth I and the ancient Iceni warrior. A speech Elizabeth I reportedly gave to her army at Tilbury before the battle against the invading Spanish Armada has some resemblance to a speech given by Boudica that was documented by the Roman historian Tacitus. 

## VICTORIOUS
Under Elizabeth I’s successor, James I, Boudica once again [fell out of favour](## "cadere in disgrazia"). Her reputation, however, was revived during the reign of Queen Victoria. The 19th-century queen who presided over the expansion of the British Empire [may well](## "potrebbe") have felt some connection with the heroic defender of Britain. Coincidentally, the women had similar names, too: Boudica can be translated as ‘victory’. In 1902 Boudica and her daughters were immortalised in a dynamic bronze statue that stands on London’s Westminster Bridge near the Houses of Parliament.
