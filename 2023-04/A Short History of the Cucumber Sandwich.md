A [cucumber](## "cetriolo") sandwich might sound [bland](## "insipido") to some, but Britons absolutely love them! This English [staple](## "alimento classico, tipico") is usually served as a light snack and almost always made with [sliced](## "tagliare a fette") white bread. In films and plays such as Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest, this elegant sandwich is often used to identify [upper-class](## "classe alta") people. But who [came up with](## "inventarsi") the idea of slicing [cucumber](## "cetriolo") and putting it in a sandwich? 

## cool as a [cucumber](## "cetriolo")
Cucumbers are an ancient vegetable that have been grown in India for around three thousand years. They were probably [brought](## "portare") to Europe by the Romans, and are documented to have been [harvested](## "raccogliere") in England since the 14th century. It is said that the 16th-century queen Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII’s first wife, loved to eat them in her [salad](## "insalata").
It wasn’t until the 19th century, however, that the [cucumber](## "cetriolo") sandwich was invented. At the time, India was colonised by Britain but many Britons there [had a hard time](## "avere difficoltà") [dealing](## "affrontare") with the [heat](## "calore"). Looking for a refreshing snack, someone decided to put [cucumber](## "cetriolo") between two slices of bread, creating the [cucumber](## "cetriolo") sandwich. The snack was a massive success, and it soon [caught on](## "prendere piede") in England, too. 

## A POSH SNACK
In Victorian England, [cucumber](## "cetriolo") sandwiches were consumed with afternoon tea, when, at around four o’clock, the [well-to-do](## "benestanti") [gathered](## "riunire") for tea, sandwiches, [scones](## "dolcetti, biscotti") and cake. Victorian elites lived primarily sedentary lives so they didn’t need to eat food with substance, like [labourers](## "operai, braccianti") did. Cucumber sandwiches are quite low-calorie, so they were perfect for them. 
In the Edwardian era (from 1901 to 1910), [cucumber](## "cetriolo")s were so popular that farmers started [growing](## "coltivare") them all year round in [glasshouses](## "serre"). The abundance of [cheap labour](## "manodopera a basso costo") and [coal](## "carbone") to [heat](## "calore") the [glasshouses](## "serre") made the production of [cucumber](## "cetriolo")s quite [profitable](## "redditizio").

## UPDATING THE CLASSIC
The classic [cucumber](## "cetriolo") sandwich is made with white bread, lightly [buttered](## "imburrare") and with the [crusts](## "croste, bordi")[cut off](## "tagliare"). The [cucumber](## "cetriolo") is thinly [sliced](## "tagliare a fette") and salt and lemon juice [added](## "aggiungere"). The sandwich is then carefully cut into triangles. Nowadays, there are some other interesting [fillings](## "farciture"): in the US, cream cheese, mayonnaise, [dill](## "aneto") and salmon are [added](## "aggiungere"), while other combinations include mixed herbs, yoghurt and olive oil. The [late](## "defunta") Queen Elizabeth II [reportedly](## "a quanto si dice") ate her [cucumber](## "cetriolo") sandwiches with [mint](## "menta") for an even-more refreshing effect. Whatever your preferences, [though](## "comunque")t, just make sure not to forget the [cucumber](## "cetriolo")!!
