## Blake Lively 2018
The actor embodied Met Gala theme ‘Heavenly Bodies: The Catholic Imagination’ with a Versace [gown](## "abito lungo") in which [burgundy](## "rosso bordeaux") meets gold and a [tight](## "stretto")** **[underdress](## "bianchieria") is covered by a voluptuous outer skirt with an extremely long tail. The combination of colours recalled the Byzantine era, while the shapes of Lively’s [gown](## "abito lungo") were influenced by both the Renaissance and the Baroque period: it was in the time between these two eras that the female [hourglass figure](## "figura a clessidra") became central to fashion. This choice allowed the actress to wear a particularly sensual look. 

## Claire Danes 2016
This pale blue dress by Zac Posen featured a wide skirt and a fibre optics mechanism which caused it to shine in the dark. Very [tight](## "stretto") in the [waist,](## "vita") this dress recalled Disney’s 1950s [Cinderella](## "Cenerentola"). It was a [clever take](## "versione intelligente") on the theme of that year, ‘Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology’, since it was a pioneering technology that allowed it to light up. It was one of the most talked-about looks of the night.

## Naomi Campbell 1995
In 1995, Naomi Campbell [attended](## "presenziare") the Met Gala accompanied by Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace, who dressed her in a sublime, [glittering](## "scintillante") dress, both long and [tight](## "stretto"), that highlighted Campbell’s [slim](## "magra") figure while causing her to appear to be [wrapped](## "avvolgere") in [stardust](## "polvere di stelle"). This was the era of the supermodel, when Campbell joined models such as Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford to become an icon of the 90s. This shiny [gown](## "abito lungo") served to highlight her stardom status.

## Bella Hadid 2017
Hadid’s [sleek](## "liscio") and sexy [catsuit](## "tuta aderente elasticizzata") went viral on the internet when designer Alexander Wang dressed her in it in 2017. The model’s look interpreted the theme of the year, that of the avant-garde, as she wore a body-suit to an event which usually sees its guests dressed in traditional [ball](## "ballo") [gown](## "abito lungo")s. Hadid herself, who [was actually sewn into](## "le hanno cucito il vestito addosso") the [glittering](## "scintillante") [catsuit](## "tuta aderente elasticizzata"), was a key part of the look.

## Emily Ratajkowski 2021
In 2021, designer Vera Wang dressed Ratajkowski, one of the most high-pro- file models in the world. Ratajkowski, who is [politically engaged](## "attiva politicamente") activist and a feminist writer, wore a custom [crimson](## "porpora") red [strapless](## "senza spalline") [gown](## "abito lungo") with a trumpet silhouette. The [lace](## "di pizzo") dress was worn with a [crimson](## "porpora") red, hand- cut organza floral neck piece. In a year that honoured American fashion, Ratajkowski wore the romantic tones typical of Wang, an iconic bridal fashion designer.
