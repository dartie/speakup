# The Doomsday Clock: Ticking Closer to Midnight   [A2]

Questo orologio misura ogni anno quanto tempo manca alla “mezzanotte” del pianeta terra. Le sue lancette si spostano in funzione del rischio di autodistruzione della nostra specie.

We've never been [closer](## "più vicini") to global annihilation. That’s [according to](## "secondo") the [Doomsday](## "apocalisse, fine del mondo") Clock, which is a symbolic representation of how close we are to destroying the world through nuclear war, the global climate emergency and disruptive technology. On the clock, midnight represents a hypothetical global catastrophe, and the number of minutes and seconds we are to midnight shows how close we are to [such an event](## "questo tipo di evento"). This January we moved from one hundred to ninety seconds to midnight — the closest to annihilation we’ve ever been!

## Who [set](## "regolare")s the clock?
The [Doomsday](## "apocalisse, fine del mondo") Clock was introduced in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. This US [non-profit organisation](## "organizzazione senza scopo di lucro") was founded after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the same scientists that helped [develop](## "sviluppare") the world’s first nuclear [weapons](## "armi"). The [aim](## "obiettivo, scopo") was to educate people about them. Today, eighteen experts from the fields of [policy](## "politica"), diplomacy, military history and nuclear science [make up](## "costituire, formare") the Bulletin’s Science and Security [Board](## "Consiglio"). In consultation with the Bulletin’s [Board](## "Consiglio") of Sponsors, which includes numerous Nobel [laureates](## "vincitori del premio"), they [update](## "aggiornare") the time on the clock every January, based on current catastrophic [threats](## "minacce") to the planet and humanity.

## Backwards and forwards
Originally, the clock was used to measure the danger specifically [posed](## "rappresentare") by nuclear [weapons](## "armi"); in 1947, it was [set](## "regolare") at seven minutes to midnight to represent this threat. [However](## "tuttavia"), in 2007, the Bulletin began considering the threat of climate change, too. It now also considers the threat [posed](## "rappresentare") by disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology. The [furthest](## "il punto più lontano") the clock has been from midnight was seventeen minutes in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was signed. The reason it moved to its closest point this year was primarily but not exclusively Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has revived fears of nuclear war.

## Turn back the clock
“We are living in a time of [unprecedented](## "senza precedenti") danger,” said Rachel Bronson, president and [CEO](## "amministratore delegato (chief executive officer)") of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. She and her colleagues, past and present, have always insisted that the clock is [intended](## "da intendersi") not to [frighten](## "spaventare") people, but to [encourage](## "spingere") them [to take action](## "prendere iniziative") to make the world a [safer](## "più sicuro") place. “The US government, its [NATO](## "Organizzazione del Trattato dell’Atlantico del Nord") [allies](## "alleati") and Ukraine have a multitude of channels for dialogue; we [urge](## "esortare") leaders to explore all of them [to their fullest ability](## "al massimo delle loro capacità") [to turn back](## "riportare indietro") the clock,” she said.
