# The 50th Anniversary of the First Mobile Phonecall   [B2]

Mezzo secolo fa un ingegnere della Motorola fece una chiamata usando un prototipo di telefono portatile, il primo del suo genere. Adesso non possiamo più farne a meno: per parlare, mandare messaggi, vedere film, trovare indirizzi, lavorare... per non parlare dell’uso delle reti sociali.

Fifty years ago, an event [took place](## "aver luogo, succedere") that would transform the way we live. On 3 April 1973, the very first mobile phone call was made, [heralding](## "annunciare") a new era of global, continuous connectivity. Motorola engineer Martin ‘Marty’ Cooper was walking on New York’s Sixth Avenue when he called rival inventor Jo- el Engel of Bell Laboratories at AT&T. He informed Engel that he was calling from a [portable](## "portatile") telephone. Engel responded with silence, but history was made.

## SHOEBOX PHONE
At the time, car phones already existed, but were [powered](## "alimentare") by heavy equipment that had to be [stored](## "riporre, conservare") in the [boot](## "bagagliaio"). This mobile prototype, named the DynaTAC (short for ‘dynamic [adaptive](## "adattabile") total area coverage’), could be [carried around](## "portare in giro") but was still the size of a shoebox. It only had a half-hour battery life, and it took ten hours to charge. However, the press enthusiastically reported about a new concept of a “[take-along](## "portatile") phone”; for the first time, phone calls were [tied](## "legare") to a person, not a place or a car.

## YUPPIE GADGET
Marty Cooper and his team worked for years to reduce the phone’s size. Finally, in 1983, the world’s first commercially-available [handheld](## "portatile, tascabile") mobile phone was released. The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X was 25cm tall, without the antenna, [weighed](## "pesare") 790g and cost $3,995. It became the ultimate yuppie (young urban professional) accessory, a symbol of wealth but also of gratuitous [spending](## "spesa, acquisto").

## POPULARITY
In just fifty years, however, Cooper’s invention has revolutionised our world. The cell phone is no longer considered a status symbol, it is a necessity. Smartphones, introduced in 1993, became ubiquitous by the 2000s. Since then, phones have become [slimmer](## "più sottili"), lighter and more powerful, and can cost from $50 to $1,500 for the latest iPhone. According to recent statistics, the [current](## "attuale") number of cell phone owners is 7.33 billion, over 91 per cent of the world’s population; 66 per cent own a smartphone. 

## TECH PIONEER
Cooper worked for Motorola for twenty-nine years, contributing to significant inventions, including [pagers](## "cercapersone") and two-way radio [dispatch](## "messaggio, comunicazione") systems. He set up several businesses with his wife, Arlene Harris, also a [wireless](## "senza cavo") tech inventor. Now, at ninety-four, he still [sits on several committees](## "esser membro di un comitato") in the industry. [Despite](## "anche se") cell phones’ reported negative effects on mental health, Cooper considers them a good thing for humanity. He believes they can improve healthcare and even eradicate poverty. As he told CBS News: “We are only at the very, very beginning. I know I sound like an optimist, but poverty is going to be a thing of the past.” A movie based on his autobiography Cutting the [Cord](## "cavo") is [current](## "attuale")ly in production.
