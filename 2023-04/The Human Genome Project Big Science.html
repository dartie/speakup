<p>Questa iniziativa di collaborazione scientifica internazionale venne portata a termine vent’anni fa: un progetto senza precedenti nell’ambito della ricerca medica, con un metodo innovativo e multidisciplinare che aprì un universo di possibilità per combattere le malattie genetiche.</p>

<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid, or <a href="##" title="acido desossiribonucleico">DNA</a>, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. It was first <a href="##" title="isolare">isolated</a> in 1869. However, it took over a century of development before the field of genomics — the study of genes and their functions — was to transform science and medicine. </p>

<h2 id="origins">ORIGINS</h2>

<p>In 1984, Italian-American virologist Renato Dulbecco suggested that given the advancements in genomics, knowing and ordering (or ‘sequencing’) the human genome — a human being’s complete set of <a href="##" title="acido desossiribonucleico">DNA</a> — would help understand cancer, the most common human genetic disease. Dulbecco, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1975, was more ambitious than many biologists; they <a href="##" title="sostenere">argued</a> that <a href="##" title="destinare">channelling</a> resources to one big science project was risky and <a href="##" title="ingiusto">unfair</a> to small research units, the usual way of doing science <a href="##" title="fino a quel momento">up until then</a>. In 1988, however, the US National Academy of Science committee report <a href="##" title="appoggiare, sostenere">endorsed</a> the project, and <a href="##" title="finanziamento">funding</a> to start a three-billion-dollar, fifteen-year programme was received. </p>

<h2 id="process">PROCESS</h2>

<p>The Human Genome Project officially began in October 1990. It was the largest international collaboration ever <a href="##" title="intraprendere">undertaken</a> in biology. Thousands of scientists working in multiple centres across the US, China, Japan, France, Germany and the UK <a href="##" title="formare una squadra">teamed up</a>. It was decided to sequence the smaller genomes first, such as mouse, <a href="##" title="verme">worm</a> and fruit fly (all with significant gene similarities to human), before <a href="##" title="affrontare">taking on</a> the <a href="##" title="impegnativo">challenging</a> human genome. On 14 April 2003, the Human Genome Project was declared completed.</p>

<h2 id="results">RESULTS</h2>

<p>Dulbecco died in 2012, but he lived to see his idea transform cancer research, as well as that of other genetic illnesses: from cystic fibrosis, resulting from mutations in a single gene, to Alzheimer’s, where many genes are <a href="##" title="coinvolgere">involved</a>. It helped doctors identify hereditary mutations and led to the development of new technologies and tools for testing and analysis. 
<a href="##" title="inoltre">What’s more</a> the Human Genome Project marked a whole new <a href="##" title="approccio">approach</a> to science that was to be crucial in combatting the Covid pandemic. Combining the expertise of biologists, engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians, it established an open <a href="##" title="approccio">approach</a> to data sharing and <a href="##" title="software con codice aperto">open-source software</a>, making the project’s <a href="##" title="scoperte">findings</a> accessible to everyone.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">THE FUTURE</h2>

<p>New initiatives have been set up to <a href="##" title="affinare">fine-tune</a> the sequencing process, and significant advancements have been made in <a href="##" title="mirare">targeted</a> and personalised treatments. In 2020, the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was <a href="##" title="assegnare">awarded</a> to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier for their work in genome editing. They developed a technique known as CRISPR/Cas9 that can repair errors in the <a href="##" title="acido desossiribonucleico">DNA</a> itself. This type of research was made possible by the Human Genome Project.
