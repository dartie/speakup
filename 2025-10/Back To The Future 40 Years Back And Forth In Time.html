<p>Great Scott! Back to the Future is forty years old this year. The iconic movie is <a href="##" title="amato">beloved</a> by generations past, present and, no doubt, future, for its mix of science fiction, comedy and 1950s’ nostalgia and for exploring the consequences of altering the past and the importance of accepting one’s destiny. </p>

<h2 id="the-story-and-characters">THE STORY AND CHARACTERS</h2>

<p><a href="##" title="distribuire, rilasciare">Released</a> in July 1985, Back to the Future <a href="##" title="avere come protagonista">stars</a> young-looking twenty-three-year-old actor Michael J. Fox as teenager Marty McFly. McFly accidentally travels back to 1955 in a DeLorean, a fictional time-travelling vehicle built by eccentric scientist Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd.) While there, McFly <a href="##" title="inavvertitamente">inadvertently</a> prevents his teenage parents from falling in love, risking his own existence. And so he has to reconcile his parents and return to the future. </p>

<h2 id="rejected-40-times">REJECTED 40+ TIMES</h2>

<p>Robert Zemeckis directed and wrote Back to the Future with his writing partner Bob Gale. They <a href="##" title="pensare, venire in mente">came up with</a> the idea in 1980, but it was rejected by over forty studios before Universal Pictures agreed to <a href="##" title="portare avanti, accettare la sfida">take it on</a>. The filmmaker wanted Fox to play Marty, but Fox wasn’t available so they initially gave the role to an actor named Eric Stoltz. However, they later decided that Stoltz wasn’t right for the role and so changed the <a href="##" title="programma">schedule</a> to accommodate Fox. This required re-filming some of the scenes, which cost millions of dollars — money we now know was well spent! </p>

<h2 id="a-phenomenal-success">A PHENOMENAL SUCCESS</h2>

<p>Back to the Future was a critical and commercial success. It made over $380 million globally in 1985 and became the <a href="##" title="con il maggior incasso">highest-grossing</a> film that year, going on to win many awards. It also inspired two sequels and a multimedia franchise that includes <a href="##" title="attrazioni di parchi di divertimento">theme park rides</a>, video games, an animated TV series and a theatrical musical.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-future-day">BACK TO THE FUTURE DAY</h2>

<p>There’s even an official Back to the Future Day on 21 October, as McFly travels back to that date in Back to the Future II. This year, fans will celebrate the first film all year round with special tributes and <a href="##" title="proiezioni">screenings</a>, no doubt <a href="##" title="citare">quoting</a> famous phrases from the movie such as “Great Scott!”, “Flux capacitor” and “88 miles per hour”.  </p>
