<p>Olivia: Hello, it’s Olivia here. I’m calling to confirm the details of my visit next week.
James: Oh, yes. I’m looking forward to meeting you in person!
Olivia: <a href="##" title="anch’io">Same here</a>! My flight <a href="##" title="atterrare">lands</a> at 10.30, so I should be at your offices around noon.
James: Are you sure you don’t want me to pick you up?
Olivia: No, that’s alright. It’s easy to take a taxi. 
James: OK. We’re on a big industrial estate. Tell the taxi to take the entrance on the south side.
Olivia: OK, I will. I can’t wait to see the new production plant!
James: You’ll love it – it’s state of the art! We’ll do a tour of the facilities and then break for lunch.
Olivia: Will the whole team be there?
James: Sarah and I will join you for lunch, but all of us will be there for the meeting in the afternoon.
Olivia: Great! </p>

<h2 id="now-let-s-review-the-vocabulary">NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!</h2>

<p>When identifying yourself in a telephone call, you can say, It’s (your name) or “This is (your name).”
When stating the <a href="##" title="scopo">purpose</a> of your call, it’s usual to say, I’m calling to (confirm / check / enquire about, etc).
It is clear that the speakers have only had contact remotely – via email or phone – and now, they will meet in person, in other words, face to face, with both of them present.
Noon refers to midday, 12pm.
To pick someone up means to collect them, usually in a car.
No, that’s alright, is a polite way of saying “No, don’t worry about it.”
An industrial estate is an area of land <a href="##" title="sviluppata, progettata">developed</a> as a site for factories and other industrial businesses.
A production plant refers to a factory or industrial <a href="##" title="struttura">facility</a> where <a href="##" title="merce, prodotti">goods</a> are manufactured.
State of the art means it is technologically advanced.
Facilities refers to the buildings, plants and offices of the organisation.
To break (for lunch) means to stop working for a period of time.</p>
