The legitimacy of the monarchies of the past was [rooted as much in](## "basarsi") the use of force and an [alleged](## "presunto") divine mandate as in ceremony and performance, with strong hierarchies and complex codes and rituals. The Trump presidency replicates many of the dynamics of a dynastic court, where everything gravitates around a single figure who [prizes](## "premiare") loyalty above all else. 

## BLOOD TIES AND YES-MEN
The President’s [inner circle](## "cerchia ristretta") is, unsurprisingly, composed largely of [blood relations](## "legami di sangue"); of Trump’s five children, the three eldest — Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric — and their spouses have held official roles or benefited from their proximity to power in their private [ventures](## "imprese") (or both).
The court intrigues become much more volatile when it comes to the second circle of influence, composed of [trusted appointees](## "incaricati fidati") and other [yes-men](## "leccapiedi, che dicono sempre sì"). Among them, Vice-President J. D. Vance is the [courtier](## "cortigiano") per excellence. Once a fierce critic of Trump, whom he called  “America’s Hitler”, Vance made a dramatic [U-turn](## "inversione di marcia") and publicly expressed [regret](## "rammarico") for his remarks. As a [token of mercy](## "gesto di misericordia"), but also persuaded of Vance’s appeal to working-class Midwestern voters, Trump selected him as his 2024 [running mate](## "compagno di candidatura, vice").
[If constitutional term limits hold](## "se si rispettano i termini costituzionali"), Vance would be the logical name for the Republican nomination in 2028. So far, however, his most memorable contribution to American politics has been acting like the [bully’s sidekick](## "la spalla del bullo") during the [scolding](## "ramanzina") of Ukraine’s prime minister Volodymyr Zelensky in front of the world media in an Oval Office meeting in February 2025.

## THE WORLD’S RICHEST MAN
Looking from the outside now is Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, who [had Trump’s ear](## "essere in confidenza con qualcuno, essere benvoluto da qualcuno") but eventually lost his favour. After spending $44 billion to acquire X and turning it into Trump’s primary propaganda machine, Musk was [appointed](## "nominare") head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a [short-lived](## "breve, effimera") initiative aimed at cutting federal spending. He [failed miserably](## "fallire miseramente") after just four months.
At the time of writing, however, they [have fallen out](## "litigare") [bitterly](## "amaramente"), with Musk even posting on X that Trump’s name [features](## "essere presente") on the mysterious list of clients of convicted and [deceased](## "defunto") sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. It is impossible to predict what will come next in the Trump-Musk affair. The latest development is Musk announcing the foundation of a new political party and Trump insinuating that Musk should be deported to South Africa. Still, no one can [rule out](## "escludere") another reconciliation if it serves their interests, followed, perhaps, by yet another falling out in perpetuity.

## KINGS AND QUEENS
Today, there are some thirty kings and queens as heads of state worldwide, but only six of them — such as those in Saudi Arabia, Brunei, or Oman — actually rule. The [complexion](## "aspetto") of Trump’s second administration is increasingly resembling one of these royal courts, where influence and favour, not meritocracy, are the [currency](## "valuta") of power, and where the ultimate goal is not the common good but the perpetuation of the dynasty and the preservation of the privileges of the few.  

## LADY MELANIA
The role of [FLOTUS](## "sigla di First Lady of the United States") is not formally defined, but much like the consorts in royal courts of old, it is largely ceremonial and representative. However, since 1798 there have been first ladies that have transcended the traditional [duties](## "doveri") as official [hostess](## "padrona di casa") for White House events and state dinners. Most notably, Hillary Clinton and Eleanor Roosevelt, who, among other achievements, helped [draft](## "elaborare, redigere") the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as US representative to the United Nations.
So far, Melania Trump’s [tenure](## "incarico") as First Lady has more often [made the headlines](## "fare notizia") for her fashion choices than for her charitable work or public statements. Born in Slovenia in 1970, Melania began modelling at sixteen, working in Milan and Paris before moving to New York in her mid-twenties. She met Donald Trump (twenty-four years her senior) at a party in 1998, and after a brief breakup, they reunited and married in 2005. A year later, she gave birth to their son, Barron, and became a US citizen.
Elegant and enigmatic, in 2017 she [delayed](## "ritardare") her move to the White House — it is said that she stays in a separate bedroom — by several months to allow Barron to finish the school year. Her low public profile and her cool, sometimes [detached](## "distante") [demeanour](## "atteggiamento") have [sparked](## "provocare") speculation. Some try to decipher her every gesture and expression as signs of discomfort, invoking the trope of the [damsel in distress](## "damigella in pericolo") or the princess trapped in a tower waiting to be saved. 
Is she she just focused on her role as a mother and wife or is her silence a sign of complicity in her husband’s politics and conduct? Why is she [unwilling](## "riluttante, restia") — or maybe afraid — to [speak up](## "esprimersi, farsi sentire")? 

## THE TRUMP DYNASTY
The Trump dynasty began not with Donald, but with his father, Fred Trump, the son of German immigrants who built a real estate empire in New York during the mid-20th century. Donald, the fourth of five [siblings](## "fratelli e sorelle"), inherited and expanded the family brand, and has five children from three different mothers.
The firstborn, Donald Jr. (1977), has cultivated a network of deals among conservative-aligned media and [venture capital](## "capitale di rischio") firms, and in January 2025 he travelled to Greenland “as a tourist” to support his father’s interest in acquiring the territory. Eric (1984) has so far stayed out of Washington politics but has recently [hinted at](## "insinuare") a 2028 [presidential run](## "candidatura a presidente"), calling politics “an easy path” for him. He also works in the Trump Organization and has been heavily involved in Trump Coin, a controversial but [wildly](## "estremamente") popular crypto[currency](## "valuta") among MAGA loyalists.
Eric’s wife, Lara, was senior campaign advisor for Trump during the 2016 and 2020 elections and served as [co-chair](## "co-presidente") of the Republican National Committee in 2024. She is now reportedly considering to run for a [seat](## "posto") in the Senate for North Carolina, with Donald Trump calling her his “first choice.”
Ivanka Trump (1981) was the director of the Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship during her father’s first administration, and was considered one of Trump’s closest advisors. However, it is perhaps her husband, Jared Kushner, the most powerful member of the extended family, who has been the subject of media allegations of [crony capitalism](## "capitalismo clientelare").
Kushner served as a senior advisor to the President during Trump’s first term, overseeing key issues such as Middle East peace negotiations, criminal justice reform and the Covid-19 response. After leaving office, he launched a [private equity firm](## "società di investimenti privata"), which received a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s [sovereign wealth fund](## "fondo sovrano"), [raising concerns](## "sollevare preoccupazioni") about conflicts of interest.
