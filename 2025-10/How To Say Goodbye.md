Goodbye’ is a common, simple word but an important part of communication. It’s used when ending or concluding a conversation (in person or on the phone,) when leaving other people (for example at the end of a workday) or when somebody is leaving.
The [remark](## "espressione, frase") [dates back to](## "risalire") the second half of the 16th century, and originated as a contraction of ‘[God be with ye](## "Dio sia con voi")’ (‘ye’ is Old English for ‘you’) that later became ‘godbwye’. [Over time](## "col tempo"), ‘God’ evolved into ‘good’, probably influenced by expressions like ‘good day’ or ‘good evening’. The original meaning of asking for divine protection was [eventually](## "alla fine") completely lost.

## APPROPRIATE USE
The word ‘goodbye’, however, can sound a bit formal, and there are many other ways to say goodbye to someone. The most common, especially in everyday [speech](## "discorso"), is just ‘bye’, the [shortened](## "abbreviata") form of ‘goodbye’. It works well in both personal and business contexts. ‘Bye-bye’ is the spoken, informal variant of ‘bye’, often used with close friends or children. First recorded in the 18th century, its usage has always been [linked](## "collegare, fare riferimento") to [nursery](## "scuola materna") settings and baby talk.

## AMONG FRIENDS
Alternative expressions like ‘See you later’, ‘See you’, or even just ‘Later’ or ‘Laters’ (popular among teenagers) are perfect examples of the tendency the English have to shorten expressions to sound more casual.
You can also use [slang](## "colloquiali") phrases such as ‘[Catch you later](## "ci becchiamo dopo")’ or ‘Check you later’, informal, used with friends (but not with your boss!); ‘[Cheers](## "ciao, saluti")’, mostly used in the UK, works in [playful](## "giocosi") contexts, and [carries](## "portare, comportare") an [old-fashioned](## "all’antica, vecchio stampo") tone; ‘[Take care](## "stammi bene")’, [warm](## "caloroso") and [kind](## "premuroso"), used both in casual and professional contexts; ‘See you soon’, ‘Bye for now’, all friendly and [polite](## "gentili, educati").

## HOW DO YOU SAY...?
A mai più rivederci!
Good riddance!

## AT WORK
Need more formal and professional alternatives? You could try using ‘Have a nice day’, ‘Have a good day/weekend/vacation…’, ‘It was a pleasure seeing you’, ‘It was nice seeing you’, ‘[I look forward to](## "non vedo l’ora di") seeing you again’…
More options are [borrowed](## "prendere in prestito") from other languages and are [rather](## "piuttosto") common in the spoken language. They often sound [trendy](## "di moda") and informal; for example, the Italian ‘Ciao’, the Spanish ‘Adiós’, the French ‘Adieu’ and ‘Au revoir’ ([the latter](## "gli ultimi") two less frequent and sometimes ironic.)

## POLITE ENDINGS
What if someone is leaving for a long time, maybe forever? There are [plenty of](## "molte") choices: ‘Farewell’ (although it sounds very formal and literary,) ‘Until we meet again’, ‘Best of luck’, ‘[So long](## "a presto").’  

## GET IT RIGHT!
Be careful! In English, expressions like ‘Good morning’, ‘Good afternoon’, or ‘Good evening’ are [greetings](## "saluti"), used only when you meet someone, not to say goodbye. [On the other hand](## "invece, al contrario"), ‘Good night’ is used only when leaving, not to say hello.
