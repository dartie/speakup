# King Donald I: The First American Monarchy?   [B2]

Il per due volte presidente degli USA guida il Paese come se fosse il CEO di una grande azienda, ma con ambizioni da re. In tutto questo, c’è spazio per la democrazia?

Democracy is obsolete, they think. As a governing system, it is fundamentally [flawed](## "difettoso"), inefficient and [burdensome](## "pesante, gravoso"). It’s a [gruelling](## "estenuante") process with all of its convincing the public to vote for one candidate ([never mind](## "figurarsi") the primaries and campaign finance regulations,) followed by endless debates, legislative compromises and institutional [checks](## "controlli"). Worst of all, democracy is bad for business.
This thesis is not new, but it is [gaining traction](## "guadagnare terreno, prendere piede") among certain economic and political elites. And as the oldest democracy and still the most powerful country in the world, the United States is also leading the way into new forms of government.

## THE CULTURE WARS
When Trump first came to power, some argued he was the [figurehead](## "figura di rappresentanza") of a new kind of fascism. Indeed, he had triumphed by [tapping into](## "sfruttare") the discontent of a large segment of the working class who felt [betrayed](## "tradire") by the political and cultural establishment. By [stoking](## "attizzare, alimentare") the fear of immigration and aligning with religious [zealots](## "fanatici"), the alt-right and white supremacists in the culture wars, Trump became a [trailblazer](## "pioniere") for global conservatism, a model for aspiring authoritarians seeking to exploit years of economic crisis and political [unrest](## "malcontento, inquietudine").
The fascist argument is not entirely [baseless](## "infondato"), but less than a year into Donald Trump’s second [term](## "mandato"), there are signs of a different kind of post-democratic project; something between a corporation and a monarchy, where power is centralised and exercised with little or no democratic [oversight](## "supervisione").

## A KING OR A CEO
When the [real estate tycoon](## "magnate del settore immobiliare") and the author of The Art of the [Deal](## "patto, accordo") announced his political ambitions in 2015, he [pledged](## "promettere, impegnarsi") to “manage the government like a business.” Trump’s [fondness](## "passione") for monarchies, meanwhile, has been manifest throughout his life: from his love of gold and [regal décor](## "arredamento regale") to [branding](## "mettere la propria marca") all his buildings with his name, or rather that of the American dynasty inaugurated by his father. 
Although kings [rule](## "governare, regnare") countries and CEOs [run](## "dirigere, amministrare") corporations, there are [striking](## "sorprendenti") similarities between these two forms of authority. Both rely on strong, top-down leadership. Both aim to expand their dominance: [the latter](## "quest’ultimo") by [overpowering](## "sovrastare") the competition and acquiring [market share](## "quota di mercato"); [the former](## "il primo") by annexing territory, as Trump has suggested doing with Greenland, the Panama Canal and even Canada.

## ABOVE THE LAW
Historically, kings have stood above the law. And the 45th and 47th President of the United States believes, as he said shortly after winning his second [term](## "mandato"), that the popular mandate came with “the right to do what we wanna do to make our country great again.” A few months later, he insisted by posting a quote on social media, [allegedly](## "presumibilmente") from none other than Napoleon: “He who saves his country does not violate any law.”
But making America great again is a [tall order](## "compito arduo"), and the US Constitution limits presidents to two [term](## "mandato")s, allowing for little time to accomplish his agenda. In the first hundred days of his second administration, Trump signed a record-breaking 143 executive orders, [thereby](## "quindi, in questo modo") [overriding](## "ignorare, scavalcare") the approval of Congress and [eroding](## "corrodere, sgretolare") the system of [[checks](## "controlli") and balances](## "pesi e contrappesi") established in the Constitution. In July, he managed to [pass](## "approvare") the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, a legislative package that extended tax cuts, deregulated key industries and expanded executive powers. Some see this movement as one of the first steps of Project 2025, a [blueprint](## "progetto, schema") for a post-democratic, CEO-style presidency that aims to reshape the federal government into a [streamlined](## "semplificare, ottimizzare"), loyalty-based apparatus.

## DARK ENLIGHTMENT
Still, there is a growing belief among [MAGA](## "sigla di Make America Great Again") radicals that the Constitution should be [amended](## "modificare") to allow for a third [term](## "mandato"). But even that may not be enough for those who believe democracy is [nothing short of](## "niente di meno che") [mob [rule](## "governare, regnare")](## "governo della folla, oclocrazia"). Over the past few years, a movement calling itself the Dark Enlightenment — or the Neo-reactionary movement — has [advocated](## "proporre, sostenere") a return to ancient forms of government, such as absolute monarchy. Its leading theorist, Curtis Yarvin, has influenced a number of Silicon Valley elites, most notably billionaire investor Peter Thiel. Thiel [played a pivotal role](## "giocare un ruolo fondamentale") in the rise of J. D. Vance, Trump’s vice president, [hiring](## "assumere") him at his venture capital firm and later becoming the main donor in Vance’s [pursuit](## "perseguimento") of a political career.

## ALL HAIL THE KING
But it’s not just elites with [vested interests](## "interessi acquisiti, interessi personali") who are [turning away](## "allontanarsi") from democracy. Decades of economic stagnation and political corruption have eroded public trust in the institutions that were once considered pillars of democracy, [namely](## "ossia, vale a dire") the justice system, the mainstream media, public schools and universities and even science. To many on the right, this has [built the case](## "argomentare a favore") for a Trump dynasty, which, like the monarchies of the Ancien Régime, is [rooted in](## "basarsi") a quasi-religious cult of personality. The superstructure legitimising Trump has been built on a social media ecosystem [rife with](## "pieno di") fake news, [climate change denial](## "negazione del cambiamento climatico") and [ludicrous](## "ridicola") conspiracy theories like QAnon, that [portray](## "rappresentare") the President as a messiah who plays “4-D Chess” with the rest of the world, [urging](## "esortare") followers to “trust the plan” and [dismiss](## "respingere") all criticism.
Next year, the American Republic will celebrate its 250th anniversary. One of the few shared [beliefs](## "credenze") among Americans is that the United States became a nation by rebelling against the tyranny of the English monarchy. Now the oldest democracy in the world is [in distress](## "in difficoltà, in pericolo"), it may seem that the revolutionary act would be to [hail the king](## "lunga vita al re").”
