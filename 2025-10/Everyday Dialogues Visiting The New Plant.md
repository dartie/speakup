Olivia: Hello, it’s Olivia here. I’m calling to confirm the details of my visit next week.
James: Oh, yes. I’m looking forward to meeting you in person!
Olivia: [Same here](## "anch’io")! My flight [lands](## "atterrare") at 10.30, so I should be at your offices around noon.
James: Are you sure you don’t want me to pick you up?
Olivia: No, that’s alright. It’s easy to take a taxi. 
James: OK. We’re on a big industrial estate. Tell the taxi to take the entrance on the south side.
Olivia: OK, I will. I can’t wait to see the new production plant!
James: You’ll love it – it’s state of the art! We’ll do a tour of the facilities and then break for lunch.
Olivia: Will the whole team be there?
James: Sarah and I will join you for lunch, but all of us will be there for the meeting in the afternoon.
Olivia: Great!
