Great Scott! Back to the Future is forty years old this year. The iconic movie is [beloved](## "amato") by generations past, present and, no doubt, future, for its mix of science fiction, comedy and 1950s’ nostalgia and for exploring the consequences of altering the past and the importance of accepting one’s destiny. 

## THE STORY AND CHARACTERS
[Released](## "distribuire, rilasciare") in July 1985, Back to the Future [stars](## "avere come protagonista") young-looking twenty-three-year-old actor Michael J. Fox as teenager Marty McFly. McFly accidentally travels back to 1955 in a DeLorean, a fictional time-travelling vehicle built by eccentric scientist Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd.) While there, McFly [inadvertently](## "inavvertitamente") prevents his teenage parents from falling in love, risking his own existence. And so he has to reconcile his parents and return to the future. 

## REJECTED 40+ TIMES
Robert Zemeckis directed and wrote Back to the Future with his writing partner Bob Gale. They [came up with](## "pensare, venire in mente") the idea in 1980, but it was rejected by over forty studios before Universal Pictures agreed to [take it on](## "portare avanti, accettare la sfida"). The filmmaker wanted Fox to play Marty, but Fox wasn’t available so they initially gave the role to an actor named Eric Stoltz. However, they later decided that Stoltz wasn’t right for the role and so changed the [schedule](## "programma") to accommodate Fox. This required re-filming some of the scenes, which cost millions of dollars — money we now know was well spent! 

## A PHENOMENAL SUCCESS
Back to the Future was a critical and commercial success. It made over $380 million globally in 1985 and became the [highest-grossing](## "con il maggior incasso") film that year, going on to win many awards. It also inspired two sequels and a multimedia franchise that includes [theme park rides](## "attrazioni di parchi di divertimento"), video games, an animated TV series and a theatrical musical.

## BACK TO THE FUTURE DAY
There’s even an official Back to the Future Day on 21 October, as McFly travels back to that date in Back to the Future II. This year, fans will celebrate the first film all year round with special tributes and [screenings](## "proiezioni"), no doubt [quoting](## "citare") famous phrases from the movie such as “Great Scott!”, “Flux capacitor” and “88 miles per hour”.
