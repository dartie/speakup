Lunga meno di duecento metri, la cosiddetta “strada più tortuosa del mondo” è una delle maggiori attrazioni di San Francisco. Ma merita davvero questo titolo?

Situated in the affluent Russian Hill neighbourhood of San Francisco is one of the city’s biggest attractions: a section of Lombard Street known as “[the crookedest](## "la più tortuosa") street in the world.” Every year, about two million visitors traverse this six hundred-foot [182.8 metres] section of the street, which has eight [sharp turns](## "curve strette") and a sign that recommends a maximum speed of just five miles per hour [8 kph].

## MAKING IT SAFER
This famous section of Lombard Street is on a [hill](## "collina") with a natural 27 per cent grade. In the early 1900s, this grade was too [steep](## "ripido") for most cars. So a property owner called Carl Henry suggested making it easier and safer to navigate by adding the eight turns. 
The turns were added in 1922, and in the late 1930s, the section was changed [from two- to one-way](## "da doppio senso a senso unico"), to make it even safer. Today, it is not only one of the most crooked but also one of the most picturesque streets in the US, surrounded by beautiful homes and gardens.

## NOT REALLY THE CROOKEDEST!
Some people are sceptical about the title associated with the street. That’s because Lombard Street is not really [the crookedest](## "la più tortuosa") street in the world — or even [the crookedest](## "la più tortuosa") street in San Francisco! 
A section of Vermont Street, between 20th and 22nd street on Potrero Hill, is technically more crooked. It is also the location of the annual Bring Your Own Big [Wheel](## "veicolo (lett. ruota)") race, in which people race down the [hill](## "collina") on tricycles.

## PAY TO ENTER?
[Regardless](## "a prescindere") of the validity of the title, about 250 cars an hour traverse the famous section of Lombard Street, and sometimes drivers have to wait thirty minutes or more to enter it. The city has proposed asking drivers to reserve a time and pay a [fee](## "tassa") to enter it in the future. To avoid any such congestion, or possible [fee](## "tassa")s, you can travel to the attraction using public transport and then walk along it instead.  

## HOW DO YOU SAY...?
Inversione a U.
A U-turn.
