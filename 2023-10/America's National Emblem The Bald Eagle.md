The [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") is the national emblem of the United States. It appears in many government institutions and on official documents, as well as on the president’s [flag](## "bandiera"), military insignia and billions of one-dollar [bills](## "biglietti"). However, not everyone was happy about its [choice](## "scelta") as America’s national bird. 18th-century statesman Benjamin Franklin preferred the [turkey](## "tacchino"), believing the [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") to be “a bird of bad moral character”.

##  

## DISTINCTIVE STYLE
The [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") is the only eagle native to North America. It is [strikingly](## "straordinariamente") colourful, with a yellow [beak](## "becco") and eyes and a white head and [tail](## "coda") that contrast with the rest of its dark-brown [feathered](## "ricoperto di piume") body. It is not born this way: [eaglets](## "aquilotti") have a brown [beak](## "becco"), eyes and feathers, but their colours change at the age of four or five. The [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") is covered in feathers and not actually bald! The origins of the name are uncertain, but possibly derived from an old English word ‘balde’ meaning white and referring to its head. 

## TOP PREDATOR
Eagles are [apex predators](## "predatori alfa"). This means they are at the very top of the [food chain](## "catena alimentare"), and have no natural predators [to threaten](## "minacciare") them. They have very [sharp](## "acuta") eyesight and can see [prey](## "preda") from up to two miles away. They scan lakes and rivers for fish swimming near the surface, then [zoom down](## "sfrecciare giù") [to grab](## "afferrare") them with their [talons](## "artigli").

## HISTORY
The [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") has been a symbol of America since the 18th century. On 4 July 1776, the Thirteen Colonies voted to declare America independent from Great Britain. It was decided that they needed an official [seal](## "sigillo, marchio") as a symbol of the country’s “supreme power and authority.” For six years, members of Congress [argued](## "discutere") over what it should be. Finally, in 1782, the [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") was chosen.
 

## NATIVE AMERICA
Eagles are believed to be sacred by many Native American cultures and are said to carry messages between humans and the Creator. Numerous tribes use [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") feathers in spiritual ceremonies, to decorate traditional [costumes](## "costumi") or for [healing](## "cura") or purification [purposes](## "scopi"). In the US, wildlife laws prohibit possessing or selling [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") feathers or other parts, but a special law called the eagle feather law makes an exception for their use in Native American spiritual practices.

## SURVIVAL
In 1940, US Congress [passed a law](## "approvare una legge") that made it illegal to kill [bald eagle](## "aquila calva")s. However, [overhunting](## "cacciare in eccesso") and habitat [loss](## "perdita") led to a critical decline in their population. The main [culprit](## "colpevole") was DDT, a pesticide that was [banned](## "proibire") in 1973. Between 1978 and 1995 the [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") was [listed](## "classificare") as an endangered species. Today, the population has [recovered](## "recuperare") and this magnificent [bird of [prey](## "preda")](## "uccello rapace") is no longer under threat.

## THE US SEAL
It displays a [bald eagle](## "aquila calva") with a [shield](## "scudo") of thirteen red and white [stripes](## "strisce") covering the bird’s breast. In its right talon, the eagle holds an [olive branch](## "ramoscello d’ulivo"), in its left a [bundle](## "mazzetto") of thirteen [arrows](## "frecce"), and in its [beak](## "becco") it carries a [scroll](## "pergamena") bearing the words: “E Pluribus Unum” (meaning “One out of many”).
