<p>The Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming (1881-1955) made one of the most important discoveries in history when he accidentally <a href="##" title="imbattersi">happened on</a> the world’s first-ever antibiotic. Penicillin has been described as a “miracle cure” and the “single greatest victory ever <a href="##" title="ottenere">achieved</a> over <a href="##" title="malattia">disease</a>.” The discovery, made in 1928, changed the course of medicine by starting the antibiotic revolution, and it has saved the lives of millions of people.</p>

<h2 id="saving-lives">SAVING LIVES</h2>

<p>Fleming first started to make history during the First World War, working as a doctor. He saw the death of many soldiers from sepsis resulting from infected <a href="##" title="ferite">wounds</a>. In an article in the medical journal The Lancet, he said that antiseptics actually <a href="##" title="aggravare">worsened</a> some injuries, but he was ignored. He saved many soldiers’ lives by washing deep <a href="##" title="ferite">wounds</a> with saline solution.</p>

<h2 id="anti-bacterial-work">ANTI-BACTERIAL WORK</h2>

<p>After the war, Fleming returned to St. Mary’s Hospital in London, where he had been investigating anti-bacterial substances. He was a very <a href="##" title="trasandato">untidy</a> worker, which actually contributed to his success. One day in 1922, clearing up his <a href="##" title="ammuffite">mouldy</a> <a href="##" title="piastre di coltura">culture plates</a>, he noticed that one was contaminated with bacteria. One area was clear, however, where a <a href="##" title="goccia">droplet</a> of mucus had fallen from his nose weeks earlier. He then found that many body fluids contained a substance, an enzyme produced by humans that forms part of our <a href="##" title="innato, naturale">innate</a> immune system, which could dissolve certain bacteria. He named it ‘lysozyme’, and reported the discovery – but <a href="##" title="non destare interesse">to no interest</a>.</p>

<h2 id="serendipitous-discovery">SERENDIPITOUS DISCOVERY</h2>

<p>In September 1928, Fleming returned to the lab after a holiday. He had <a href="##" title="sbadatamente">carelessly</a> left some plates containing bacteria on a <a href="##" title="banco">bench</a>. He noticed that one plate was contaminated with a <a href="##" title="fungo">fungus</a> and the bacteria around the <a href="##" title="fungo">fungus</a> had been destroyed. He famously said, “That’s funny”. The source of the contaminant came from a colleague’s lab below and had entered through an open window. Fleming identified the mould as being a rare <a href="##" title="ceppo">strain</a> of the <a href="##" title="genere, specie">genus</a> Penicillium. He named the mould’s active bacteria-destroying ingredient Penicillin. It would <a href="##" title="risultare">turn out</a> to be the most effective life-saving drug in the world! Amongst others, it affected bacteria that caused scarlet fever, pneumonia and meningitis.</p>

<h2 id="a-practical-drug">A PRACTICAL DRUG</h2>

<p>Fleming published his discovery in 1929 but received little attention again. Then, in the early 1940s, a group of scientists in Oxford began studying the antibiotic’s molecular structure. Clinical <a href="##" title="prove, esperimenti">trials</a> finally verified its incredible efficacy. American pharmaceutical companies then began producing it in large quantities — enough, in fact, to treat every wounded Allied soldier in the Second World War.</p>

<h2 id="nobel-prize">NOBEL PRIZE</h2>

<p>In 1945, Fleming received the Nobel Prize. Fleming was a modest man. He once said: “When I woke up just after <a href="##" title="alba">dawn</a> on 3 September 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”</p>
