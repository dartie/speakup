# The New York Times: -A Year of Cosmic Wonder with the James Webb Space Telescope-   [C2]

Il telescopio più potente mai costruito orbita da un anno intorno al sole, a un milione e mezzo di chilometri dalla terra, per ottenere immagini inedite dell’inizio dell’universo. I risultati sono più belli e rivelatori del previsto.

By now, perhaps, we should be getting used to [unreal](## "incredibili") images of the cosmos made with the James Webb Space Telescope. But a year after NASA released the cosmic observatory’s first [imagery](## "iconografia"), the space agency has [dropped](## "pubblicare") yet another [breathtaking snapshot](## "istantanea mozzafiato") of our universe.
Wednesday’s image was Rho Ophiuchi, the closest [nursery](## "asilo nido") of infant stars in our cosmic [backyard](## "cortile"). Located a mere 390 light years away from Earth, this cloud complex is [chock-full](## "strapieno") of stellar [goodness](## "bontà, abbondanza").
Around fifty stars with masses comparable to our sun are [sprinkled](## "spruzzare") in white: some fully formed and shining bright, others still hidden behind dark, dense regions of interstellar dust.
 
Near the center of the image is a mature star called S1, its starlight illuminating the [wispy](## "sottile") yellow nebula around it. Toward the upper right are [streaming](## "fluttuare") red [jets](## "getti") of molecular hydrogen, material that gets [spewed out](## "espellere (lett. sputare)") [on either side](## "da entrambi i lati") of forming protostars. Black shadows near these regions are [accretion](## "accrescimento") disks of [swirling](## "turbinare, vorticare") gas and dust — some of which could be in the process of creating planetary systems.
The [awe](## "soggezione, ammirazione") the image inspires is comparable to how researchers feel about the Webb’s first year of science.
“As an astronomer that lives and breathes this mission, I’m having to work really hard [to keep up](## "tenere il passo") — there are so many discoveries,” said Jane Rigby, the senior project scientist for the telescope at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. She finds it [fitting](## "appropriato") that the [customary gift](## "dono consueto") for one-year anniversaries is paper, because that’s exactly what researchers using the telescope have been [churning out](## "sfornare") for the past year: scientific papers.
The observatory launched on Christmas in 2021, and scientists spent the next six months [prepping](## "preparare") the telescope for action: [unfolding](## "dispiegare") its [sun shield](## "scudo solare") and the [honeycomb-like](## "simile a un favo") [array](## "schiera") of golden mirrors, then running tests of the four instruments used to observe the cosmos. When it was ready, the Webb embarked on its journey [to peer into](## "scrutare") the depths of the universe.
The telescope’s agenda has been [jam-packed](## "piena zeppa") ever since. It has checked out asteroids, quasars, exoplanets and other [cosmic phenomena galore](## "fenomeni cosmici a profusione"). For Rigby, one of the most gratifying accomplishments of this past year is the way the mission has [delivered on its promise](## "mantenere una promessa") to reveal the earliest moments of cosmic time.
“That was the elevator pitch: We’re going to show you the baby pictures of the universe,” she said.
Indeed it has. Before the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers knew of only a small [handful](## "manciata") of candidate galaxies that existed in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Within the past year, hundreds of them — bigger and brighter than expected, packed with forming stars [swirling](## "turbinare, vorticare") around supermassive black holes — have been confirmed.
“The data from the telescope is better than we promised,” Rigby said. “It’s [over-performed](## "funzionare meglio del previsto") in almost every way.”
Already, the telescope’s schedule for the next year is set, with roughly 5,000 hours of [prime](## "di prima categoria") observing time for a [suite](## "insieme, pacchetto") of projects related to galactic formation, stellar chemistry, the behavior of black holes, the large-scale structure of our universe and more. Many of these projects — more ambitious than last year, now that scientists know what the telescope can do — are dedicated to [following up](## "seguire") on Webb’s own discoveries.
Though the telescope is operated by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, observers from around the globe were selected to use it. “This is the telescope for humanity, and we want the best ideas from the whole world,” Rigby said. “That’s how we’re doing things.”
