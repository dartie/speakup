# The Greatest Discovery in Medicine: Alexander Fleming   [B2]

Fu per pura casualità, se diventò uno degli scienziati più importanti della storia: una mattina di settembre si accorse che i campioni di laboratorio erano contaminati. Era la penicillina, che ogni anno salva milioni di vite.

The Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming (1881-1955) made one of the most important discoveries in history when he accidentally [happened on](## "imbattersi") the world’s first-ever antibiotic. Penicillin has been described as a “miracle cure” and the “single greatest victory ever [achieved](## "ottenere") over [disease](## "malattia").” The discovery, made in 1928, changed the course of medicine by starting the antibiotic revolution, and it has saved the lives of millions of people.

## SAVING LIVES
Fleming first started to make history during the First World War, working as a doctor. He saw the death of many soldiers from sepsis resulting from infected [wounds](## "ferite"). In an article in the medical journal The Lancet, he said that antiseptics actually [worsened](## "aggravare") some injuries, but he was ignored. He saved many soldiers’ lives by washing deep [wounds](## "ferite") with saline solution.

## ANTI-BACTERIAL WORK
After the war, Fleming returned to St. Mary’s Hospital in London, where he had been investigating anti-bacterial substances. He was a very [untidy](## "trasandato") worker, which actually contributed to his success. One day in 1922, clearing up his [mouldy](## "ammuffite") [culture plates](## "piastre di coltura"), he noticed that one was contaminated with bacteria. One area was clear, however, where a [droplet](## "goccia") of mucus had fallen from his nose weeks earlier. He then found that many body fluids contained a substance, an enzyme produced by humans that forms part of our [innate](## "innato, naturale") immune system, which could dissolve certain bacteria. He named it ‘lysozyme’, and reported the discovery – but [to no interest](## "non destare interesse").

## SERENDIPITOUS DISCOVERY
In September 1928, Fleming returned to the lab after a holiday. He had [carelessly](## "sbadatamente") left some plates containing bacteria on a [bench](## "banco"). He noticed that one plate was contaminated with a [fungus](## "fungo") and the bacteria around the [fungus](## "fungo") had been destroyed. He famously said, “That’s funny”. The source of the contaminant came from a colleague’s lab below and had entered through an open window. Fleming identified the mould as being a rare [strain](## "ceppo") of the [genus](## "genere, specie") Penicillium. He named the mould’s active bacteria-destroying ingredient Penicillin. It would [turn out](## "risultare") to be the most effective life-saving drug in the world! Amongst others, it affected bacteria that caused scarlet fever, pneumonia and meningitis.

## A PRACTICAL DRUG
Fleming published his discovery in 1929 but received little attention again. Then, in the early 1940s, a group of scientists in Oxford began studying the antibiotic’s molecular structure. Clinical [trials](## "prove, esperimenti") finally verified its incredible efficacy. American pharmaceutical companies then began producing it in large quantities — enough, in fact, to treat every wounded Allied soldier in the Second World War.

## NOBEL PRIZE
In 1945, Fleming received the Nobel Prize. Fleming was a modest man. He once said: “When I woke up just after [dawn](## "alba") on 3 September 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.”
