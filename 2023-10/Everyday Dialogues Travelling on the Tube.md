Lea: Hi, I need to travel on the**Tube**, but I don’t have an **Oyster card**. Is that possible?
John: Yes, of course, you can still buy **paper tickets**. But there are Visitor Oyster cards, too, you know.
Lea: Oh, really? I didn’t know that. Isn’t that a lot more expensive, [though](## "comunque")?
John: No, **fares** are [actually](## "in realtà") cheaper than single paper tickets or paper**Travelcards**.
Lea: But don’t I need to pay for the card itself
John: Yes, it’s a **contactless card** that costs £5. You **load it with credit** which you pay as you go.
Lea: I’m only here for the weekend. What happens if I haven’t [spent](## "spendere") it all?
John: [Whatever](## "qualunque") credit you have left never **expires**. Then, if you come back, you just **top it up**.
Lea: Oh, well, I’m sure I’ll be back, so I guess that’ll be useful. OK, one Oyster card please, with £15 credit!
John: **Here you go**. Make sure you touch your card to the reader at the start and the end of your journey, so you’ll be charged the right fare.
Lea: **Will do**. Thank you!
