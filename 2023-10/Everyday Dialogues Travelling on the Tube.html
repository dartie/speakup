<p>Lea: Hi, I need to travel on the<strong>Tube</strong>, but I don’t have an <strong>Oyster card</strong>. Is that possible?
John: Yes, of course, you can still buy <strong>paper tickets</strong>. But there are Visitor Oyster cards, too, you know.
Lea: Oh, really? I didn’t know that. Isn’t that a lot more expensive, <a href="##" title="comunque">though</a>?
John: No, <strong>fares</strong> are <a href="##" title="in realtà">actually</a> cheaper than single paper tickets or paper<strong>Travelcards</strong>.
Lea: But don’t I need to pay for the card itself
John: Yes, it’s a <strong>contactless card</strong> that costs £5. You <strong>load it with credit</strong> which you pay as you go.
Lea: I’m only here for the weekend. What happens if I haven’t <a href="##" title="spendere">spent</a> it all?
John: <a href="##" title="qualunque">Whatever</a> credit you have left never <strong>expires</strong>. Then, if you come back, you just <strong>top it up</strong>.
Lea: Oh, well, I’m sure I’ll be back, so I guess that’ll be useful. OK, one Oyster card please, with £15 credit!
John: <strong>Here you go</strong>. Make sure you touch your card to the reader at the start and the end of your journey, so you’ll be charged the right fare.
Lea: <strong>Will do</strong>. Thank you!</p>
