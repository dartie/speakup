# Jane Eyre: On the Big Screen   [B2]

Tra le quasi venti versioni cinematografiche del romanzo di Charlotte Brontë, questa si distingue in particolare per la delicatezza dell’elaborazione di Fukunaga e per le interpretazioni dell’australiana Mia Wasikowska e del tedesco-irlandese Michael Fassbender.

American filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga’s adaptation of Jane Eyre is just one of many of Charlotte Brontë’s well-known novel. However, it [stands out](## "distinguersi, spiccare") in its emotional impact and its intense yet delicate portrayal of the protagonists. 

## LONELY CHILDHOOD
Jane (played by Australian actor Mia Wasikowska) is orphaned in her youth. [Scorned](## "disprezzare") by her affluent aunt, she is sent away to a [dreadful](## "spaventoso") [boarding school](## "collegio, convitto"). However, the young Jane is characterised by her resilience and feels equal to those of higher social status. Her challenging experiences [enable](## "abilitare, permettere") her to connect with Edward Rochester (played by Irish-German actor Michael Fassbender), whose mysterious past also [haunts](## "perseguitare") him. When Mr. Rochester employs Jane as a [governess](## "governante, istitutrice") on his [estate](## "proprietà immobiliare"), the two fall in love.

## WOMANHOOD
Jane Eyre is a novel [ahead of its time](## "all’avanguardia per i suoi tempi"). It defies the notion that [seemingly](## "apparentemente") predictable roles and dynamics, such as a working young woman falling in love with her older, intriguing, wealthier master, imply superficial or [nefarious](## "nefaste") motives. The story of Jane Eyre explores themes such as class and womanhood while also being one of the most memorable romances in world literature.

## CLASS DISTINCTIONS
To portray the class distinctions between the characters, it was crucial to use appropriate language. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga highlights the significance of getting the accent right.
**Cary Joji Fukunaga (American accent)**: I think Jane Eyre is a story, that, amongst the many themes, class definitely plays a role in it. And so the accent defines which class they’re from. For example, Rochester being from the [gentry](## "aristocrazia terriera"), needs to have an accent, it’s more of the Received Pronunciation, which is the Queen’s English. And Jane and Mrs. Fairfax — Judi Dench’s character, it’s not the lower class, but it’s not the [gentry](## "aristocrazia terriera") either. So there’s a bit of refinement there, but there’s also a very regional [flair](## "stile, eleganza") to it. And then everyone else who is the servant class  what they call [broad](## "ampio") regional accent.

## FAMILIARITY
Mia Wasikowska’s challenge was to bring complexity and vivacity to a character that the public may already feel they know.
**Mia Wasikowska (Australian accent)**: It’s a real testament to her character and the story that people still connect with her now. Unlike an original character where the audience takes them for what you give them, with Jane people have an idea of who she is and and they really know her character. So there was an obligation to hopefully [deliver](## "realizzare") or that people connect and believe you as her.

## GENDER ROLES
When casting the film, Fukunaga was [aware](## "consapevole") of the importance of gender roles in the story. As he explains, the character of Jane has left her mark on history.
**Cary Joji Fukunaga**: Fassbender brings a lot of masculine energy to the role, which is exactly what I was looking for in terms of finding a man’s man actor. He brings a sense of intelligence, but also I think of [pathos](## "sentimento, emozione"). I’m not sure if I would describe Mia or Jane as being fragile. There’s a sensitivity there and an understanding of [hardship](## "avversità"), and with Mia equal to Jane, the character, there’s a sense of intelligence and curiosity and passion. But it’s young, it’s naive still. So maybe the fragility comes out in her naiveté, but I don’t think she’s fragile by any means. She might be estimated to be fragile, but actually I think you find her  as a person, also Jane Eyre as a character, very strong.
