<p>Duecento anni fa, un giovane intraprendente fondò un’azienda che produceva i suoi prodotti a mano con pestello e mortaio. Oggi i suoi prodotti (soprattutto i cioccolatini) fanno parte dell’identità britannica.</p>

<p>Two hundred years ago, in 1824, a young businessman founded a <a href="##" title="confettiera">confectionery</a> business in Birmingham, England that would go on to become one of the most important food brands in the world. Pioneers in the making of chocolate, Cadbury’s was a family firm for most of its existence until its <a href="##" title="fusione">merger</a> with Schweppes in 1969, followed by its hostile <a href="##" title="acquisizione">takeover</a> by Kraft (now Mondelēz International) in 2010. It is an important part of British culture: its iconic Dairy Milk bar still as popular today as when it was launched 119 years ago.</p>

<h2 id="sons-saved-the-business">SONS SAVED THE BUSINESS</h2>

<p>John Cadbury’s shop sold tea, coffee and drinking chocolate. A <a href="##" title="quacchero">Quaker</a>, he wanted to encourage people to stop drinking alcohol. The business was <a href="##" title="fallire">failing</a> until John’s sons Richard and George <a href="##" title="prendere il controllo">took over</a> in 1861. With the business now prospering, the sons began to introduce new products, such as <a href="##" title="uova di Pasqua">Easter eggs</a> in 1875. Giving and receiving chocolate <a href="##" title="uova di Pasqua">Easter eggs</a> is now one of Britain’s most-loved traditions. </p>

<h2 id="fair-trade-practices">FAIR TRADE PRACTICES</h2>

<p>From the beginning, John had insisted on <a href="##" title="equi">fair</a> trade practices — the <a href="##" title="fave di cacao">cocoa beans</a> came from farmers paying <a href="##" title="equi">fair</a> <a href="##" title="salari">wages</a>. George Cadbury once said: “No man <a href="##" title="dovrebbe">ought</a> to be condemned to live in a place where a rose cannot grow.” In 1893, he started to build a model village, called Bourneville, just outside Birmingham. By 1900 the <a href="##" title="proprietà immobiliari">estate</a> included 314 <a href="##" title="casette">cottages</a> and houses. Employees had pension plans and free <a href="##" title="odontoiatria">dentistry</a>. But, in accordance with the Cadbury family <a href="##" title="credenze, valori">beliefs</a>, there were no pubs. Through the generations, the family donated millions of pounds to charities, while living <a href="##" title="modesto, umile">humble</a> lives. One sister, Beatrice, lived with her eight children in a <a href="##" title="tenda">tent</a>! </p>

<h2 id="the-dairy-milk-bar">THE DAIRY MILK BAR</h2>

<p>With the <a href="##" title="alba, principio">dawning</a> of the 20th century, the company continued to prosper. In 1905, after ten years’ research, George Cadbury Jr. introduced the Dairy Milk bar. The first example of mass-produced milk chocolate, the bars had a higher con<a href="##" title="tenda">tent</a> of milk than usual. They quickly became a <a href="##" title="nome familiare">household name</a> and the country’s favourite <a href="##" title="delizia">treat</a>. By 1910 Cadbury’s was Britain’s largest manufacturer of chocolate. New products continued <a href="##" title="fluire">to flow</a> from the factory: Milk <a href="##" title="vassoio">Tray</a>(1915), Fruit and <a href="##" title="frutta a guscio">Nut</a> (1928), <a href="##" title="croccante">Crunchie</a> (1929) and Roses (1938). Cadbury still <a href="##" title="avere sotto controllo">has a firm hold</a> on the British heart … and on its sweet tooth!  </p>
