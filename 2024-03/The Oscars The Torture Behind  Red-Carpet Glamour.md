# The Oscars: The Torture Behind  Red-Carpet Glamour   [C2]

Per molte celebrità, i preparativi alla cerimonia degli Oscar includono pratiche che vanno oltre l’acconciatura e la manicure: diete drastiche, liposuzioni, botox e ansiolitici sono all’ordine del giorno.

The Oscars red carpet is often referred to by the celebrity press as the most powerful [catwalk](## "passerella") in the world. It is the [gilded](## "dorato") stage for which haute couture dresses are made; bright lights fall on film stars dressed by the world’s most [accomplished](## "esperti, abili") designers in some of the most expensive items of clothing ever made.
But for many of the nominees, what goes on in [the run-up to](## "periodo precedente") Oscar Sunday involves weeks of hunger, sacrifice and last-minute liposuction. “It is brutal,” British [facialist](## "visagista") Nichola Joss told The New York Times, of the pressure of the high-definition [close-up](## "primo piano") on Hollywood actors. “You can see a hair follicle. You can see a [pimple](## "brufolo") before it is a [pimple](## "brufolo").”
Hollywood insiders talk of actors who [plot](## "pianificare") their beauty treatments at different points around Los Angeles in a [bid](## "tentativo") [to lose](## "perdere") photographers between pedicure appointments and derma-filler treatments. Anti-anxiety pills such as Xanax are said to be widely used by nominees.
“The entire city stops normal activity and the Oscars [take over](## "prendere il sopravvento"); the atmosphere is surprisingly serious,” says gossip columnist Dean Piper, who is in LA to cover the Oscars. “Most of the [A-list](## "lista VIP") have been through the Saint-Tropez [tanning suite](## "solarium") at the Four Seasons by now, so their skin colour can [settle](## "stabilire, assestare") for Sunday. But I’m seeing stylists [whooshing](## "sfrecciare") around town in their Range Rovers, [pulling](## "tirare fuori") [gowns](## "tirare fuori") from boutiques where they are being altered, and the [nail bars](## "saloni per manicure") are [heaving](## "sospirare forte"). The actresses I’ve seen at lunch are simply [pushing leaves around](## "mescolare foglie (di insalata)") their plate.”
High-definition photography and the prevalence of social media means that actors now face having the minute details of every angle of their body and face appear in hundreds of photos online. As a result, the stakes for red-carpet glamour have never [been higher](## "la posta in gioco è alta").
“You know it’s the Oscars because suddenly everyone is on the cayenne and lemon juice diet, and talking about appointments with their [facialist](## "visagista"), podiatrist, personal trainer, stylist, dietitian, hairdresser and teams from the big fashion houses like Valentino or Dior,” says one well-known Hollywood stylist.
“Hell, darling. That is what is going on in Hollywood right now,” says stylist Cheryl Konteh, who has dressed a number of [A-list](## "lista VIP") stars, including Kate Winslet, for awards ceremonies. “Those poor actresses will have been on a diet-and-exercise regime since nomination day, all with the aim of looking perfect in their chosen dress. They have to look their healthiest possible. [There is no way around it](## "non c’è modo di evitarlo"). Skin has to [glow](## "brillare"), legs and body must be [toned](## "tonici").”
Julianne Moore has said that as soon as she learned she had been nominated for a Golden Globe, she had to start “training” fast. “It’s so unfair. The Golden Globes fall just thirteen days after the end of the Christmas holidays. Realistically, you only stop eating and drinking too much on 1 January, and I was certainly no exception,” Moore told the Sunday Times. “I did  this juice thing. I’ve never done one before, but I was desperate.”
A small army of plastic surgeons, [facialist](## "visagista")s, personal trainers and cosmetologists, such as New York-based Tracie Martyn, whose signature treatment is called The Red Carpet Facial, will [decamp](## "levare le tende") to LA for the Oscars.
A popular surgical treatment actors [resort](## "ricorrere a") to before the red carpet is last-minute liposuction on “problematic” areas of fat, such as the area just under the shoulder [blade](## "scapola") which may [bulge](## "sporgere") over the top of a [strapless dress](## "abito senza spalline"). Underarm botox is another extreme-sounding but common trick used to prevent [sweating](## "sudare") on the night.
[Underpinning](## "sostenere") all this is the sense that there is something more at stake than winning the “best-dressed Oscar star” [accolade](## "riconoscimento, lode") in a magazine or blog. These preparations often come down to money. “If an actor has a good Oscars red carpet moment, it [paves the way](## "spianare la strada") or lucrative advertising campaigns,” says The Guardian’s beauty columnist Sali Hughes.
And then, of course, they must act like it’s all such [effortless fun](## "divertimento spontaneo"). “They may try [to make out otherwise](## "fare diversamente"), but most actors will have chosen their dress over a month ago at the couture shows,” says Konteh. “When you are working with a fashion house you just have to commit, you can’t [mess the designers around](## "scherzare"). Often it’s about a working relationship. With a day to go before the Oscars, I would have [worked out](## "decidere") hair, [make-up](## "trucco") and jewellery. I would also have a Plan B outfit [lined up](## "preparare"), plus a possible change of clothes for a post-Oscar event, such as the parties held by Vanity Fair or Elton John.”
In a moment of refreshing honesty, Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar for best actress for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, [summed up](## "riassumere") her experience of the red carpet as “torture”. “I know that’s a cliche,” she told Vanity Fair, “but it’s uncomfortable having to pose when people are shouting at you and the next day you just get [slaughter](## "massacrare"). You walk out there and go: “Hate me!”
