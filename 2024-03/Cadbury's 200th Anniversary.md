# Cadbury's 200th Anniversary   [B1]

Duecento anni fa, un giovane intraprendente fondò un’azienda che produceva i suoi prodotti a mano con pestello e mortaio. Oggi i suoi prodotti (soprattutto i cioccolatini) fanno parte dell’identità britannica.

Two hundred years ago, in 1824, a young businessman founded a [confectionery](## "confettiera") business in Birmingham, England that would go on to become one of the most important food brands in the world. Pioneers in the making of chocolate, Cadbury’s was a family firm for most of its existence until its [merger](## "fusione") with Schweppes in 1969, followed by its hostile [takeover](## "acquisizione") by Kraft (now Mondelēz International) in 2010. It is an important part of British culture: its iconic Dairy Milk bar still as popular today as when it was launched 119 years ago.

## SONS SAVED THE BUSINESS
John Cadbury’s shop sold tea, coffee and drinking chocolate. A [Quaker](## "quacchero"), he wanted to encourage people to stop drinking alcohol. The business was [failing](## "fallire") until John’s sons Richard and George [took over](## "prendere il controllo") in 1861. With the business now prospering, the sons began to introduce new products, such as [Easter eggs](## "uova di Pasqua") in 1875. Giving and receiving chocolate [Easter eggs](## "uova di Pasqua") is now one of Britain’s most-loved traditions. 

## FAIR TRADE PRACTICES
From the beginning, John had insisted on [fair](## "equi") trade practices — the [cocoa beans](## "fave di cacao") came from farmers paying [fair](## "equi") [wages](## "salari"). George Cadbury once said: “No man [ought](## "dovrebbe") to be condemned to live in a place where a rose cannot grow.” In 1893, he started to build a model village, called Bourneville, just outside Birmingham. By 1900 the [estate](## "proprietà immobiliari") included 314 [cottages](## "casette") and houses. Employees had pension plans and free [dentistry](## "odontoiatria"). But, in accordance with the Cadbury family [beliefs](## "credenze, valori"), there were no pubs. Through the generations, the family donated millions of pounds to charities, while living [humble](## "modesto, umile") lives. One sister, Beatrice, lived with her eight children in a [tent](## "tenda")! 

## THE DAIRY MILK BAR
With the [dawning](## "alba, principio") of the 20th century, the company continued to prosper. In 1905, after ten years’ research, George Cadbury Jr. introduced the Dairy Milk bar. The first example of mass-produced milk chocolate, the bars had a higher con[tent](## "tenda") of milk than usual. They quickly became a [household name](## "nome familiare") and the country’s favourite [treat](## "delizia"). By 1910 Cadbury’s was Britain’s largest manufacturer of chocolate. New products continued [to flow](## "fluire") from the factory: Milk [Tray](## "vassoio")(1915), Fruit and [Nut](## "frutta a guscio") (1928), [Crunchie](## "croccante") (1929) and Roses (1938). Cadbury still [has a firm hold](## "avere sotto controllo") on the British heart … and on its sweet tooth!
