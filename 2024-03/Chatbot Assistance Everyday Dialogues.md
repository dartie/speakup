Mike: Hey, ChatBot! I have a job interview tomorrow. What do you think they will ask me?
Jivochat: “What is your name?”
Mike: Duh, of course! So, I’m applying for a receptionist job. What’s a typical question they will ask?
Jivochat: “Are you a polite and [welcoming](## "accogliente") person?”
Mike: Are my prompts not specific enough? Right, so, the interview is for the post of receptionist at a design agency. What will the agency want to know about me?
Jivochat: “Are you human?”
Mike: Are you hallucinating? But, really, what [advice](## "consiglio") can you give me?
Jivochat: Receptionists are the public face of the company. Dress appropriately.
Mike: [sighs] Yeah, sure. OK, last [chance](## "possibilità, occasione"): give me three possible behavioural interview questions for a receptionist job interview.
Jivochat:“Tell me about a time when you had to deal with an unwanted visitor. How did you [handle](## "gestire") the situation?”
Jivochat: “Describe a situation where you had to juggle priorities. What did you do?”
Jivochat: “Have you ever had to make a quick decision with limited information? What was your decision and its [outcome](## "risultato")?”
Mike: Now that’s more like it! 

## NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!
A**job interview**is a formal meeting between a [recruiting company](## "azienda di reclutamento") and a person looking for a job, [to assess](## "valutare") the candidate’s suitability.
‘**Duh**!’ is [slang](## "gergo"), an exclamation used to show that a comment is either obvious or stupid or both.
In artificial intelligence, a ‘**prompt**’ is a request that allows the AI program to generate a response.
A ‘**post**’ in this context is another word for ‘job’ or ‘position of employment’.
“**Are you human**?” is not an unreasonable response: chatbots are increasingly used for recruitment purposes.
AIs can, in fact, ‘**hallucinate**’! This is when the program insists that something is true when in fact it is not.
To be the ‘**public face**’ means ‘to represent’, in this case, the design agency.
**Behavioural interview questions** are questions that assess a job candidate’s actions and reactions in specific professional [settings](## "scenari, contesti") or situations.
Literally, ‘**to juggle**’ means to keep a number of balls or objects continuously in the air; in this context, it refers to the ability to do multiple things at the same time; in other words, to multi-task.
The idiom ‘**that’s more like it**!’ is used to show that you think something has [improved](## "migliorare") or someone has offered a better idea or answer to a question than at first.
