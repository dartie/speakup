<p>Mike: Hey, ChatBot! I have a job interview tomorrow. What do you think they will ask me?
Jivochat: “What is your name?”
Mike: Duh, of course! So, I’m applying for a receptionist job. What’s a typical question they will ask?
Jivochat: “Are you a polite and <a href="##" title="accogliente">welcoming</a> person?”
Mike: Are my prompts not specific enough? Right, so, the interview is for the post of receptionist at a design agency. What will the agency want to know about me?
Jivochat: “Are you human?”
Mike: Are you hallucinating? But, really, what <a href="##" title="consiglio">advice</a> can you give me?
Jivochat: Receptionists are the public face of the company. Dress appropriately.
Mike: [sighs] Yeah, sure. OK, last <a href="##" title="possibilità, occasione">chance</a>: give me three possible behavioural interview questions for a receptionist job interview.
Jivochat:“Tell me about a time when you had to deal with an unwanted visitor. How did you <a href="##" title="gestire">handle</a> the situation?”
Jivochat: “Describe a situation where you had to juggle priorities. What did you do?”
Jivochat: “Have you ever had to make a quick decision with limited information? What was your decision and its <a href="##" title="risultato">outcome</a>?”
Mike: Now that’s more like it! </p>

<h2 id="now-let-s-review-the-vocabulary">NOW LET’S REVIEW THE VOCABULARY!</h2>

<p>A<strong>job interview</strong>is a formal meeting between a <a href="##" title="azienda di reclutamento">recruiting company</a> and a person looking for a job, <a href="##" title="valutare">to assess</a> the candidate’s suitability.
‘<strong>Duh</strong>!’ is <a href="##" title="gergo">slang</a>, an exclamation used to show that a comment is either obvious or stupid or both.
In artificial intelligence, a ‘<strong>prompt</strong>’ is a request that allows the AI program to generate a response.
A ‘<strong>post</strong>’ in this context is another word for ‘job’ or ‘position of employment’.
“<strong>Are you human</strong>?” is not an unreasonable response: chatbots are increasingly used for recruitment purposes.
AIs can, in fact, ‘<strong>hallucinate</strong>’! This is when the program insists that something is true when in fact it is not.
To be the ‘<strong>public face</strong>’ means ‘to represent’, in this case, the design agency.
<strong>Behavioural interview questions</strong> are questions that assess a job candidate’s actions and reactions in specific professional <a href="##" title="scenari, contesti">settings</a> or situations.
Literally, ‘<strong>to juggle</strong>’ means to keep a number of balls or objects continuously in the air; in this context, it refers to the ability to do multiple things at the same time; in other words, to multi-task.
The idiom ‘<strong>that’s more like it</strong>!’ is used to show that you think something has <a href="##" title="migliorare">improved</a> or someone has offered a better idea or answer to a question than at first.</p>
