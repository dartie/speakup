<p>Il grande successo degli Wham!, il duo che fece di George Michael una stella, è l’opposto di un classico canto di Natale. Anche se il ritmo sia molto natalizio, parla in realtà della sfortuna in amore e del rimorso.</p>

<p>One of the best-known Christmas songs in history is not about Christmas <a href="##" title="per niente">at all</a>. The 1984 festive favourite by British band Wham! is about a <a href="##" title="fallita">failed</a> relationship. Twenty-one-year-old George Michael (whose real name was Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou) wrote the song in his childhood bedroom while visiting his parents, with <a href="##" title="compagno di gruppo musicale">bandmate</a> Andrew Ridgeley watching TV <a href="##" title="nell’appartamento di sotto">downstairs</a>. When they recorded it in August, they decorated the studio to create a Christmas atmosphere. George Michael insisted on playing all the instruments, <a href="##" title="nonostante">despite</a> having no musical <a href="##" title="preparazione">training</a>.
The song was a phenomenal success, spending five weeks at No.2 in the <a href="##" title="classifiche musicali">charts</a>. It was <a href="##" title="lasciata fuori">kept off</a> <a href="##" title="il primo posto">the top spot</a> by the <a href="##" title="ricco di star">star-studded</a> charity single Do They Know It’s Christmas?, which also <a href="##" title="presentare">featured</a> George Michael. In solidarity, all <a href="##" title="guadagni, profitti">proceeds</a> from Last Christmas were donated to Ethiopian <a href="##" title="aiuti contro la fame">famine relief</a>. Lyrically, the song is as simple as a <a href="##" title="ninna nanna">nursery rhyme</a>, with the <a href="##" title="ritornello">chorus</a> in the past simple and future. Although the narrator implies he has <a href="##" title="andare avanti">moved on</a>, it is clear to the listener that he is still in love with his ex. 
Last Christmas remains the UK’s most-played Christmas song, and has been widely <a href="##" title="creare una versione">covered</a>, with recent versions by Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and even Crazy Frog. Each day of the festive season the original is viewed on YouTube over one million times. The inspiration for a 2019 movie starring Emilia Clarke, it even <a href="##" title="generare">spawned</a> a competition called Whamaggedon, where the winner is the person who goes <a href="##" title="più a lungo">the longest</a> in December without hearing the song. Last Christmas finally reached No.1 in the UK in January 2021, thirty-six years after it was written, and five years after George Michael tragically died — on Christmas Day.
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special
Chorus
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it’s been a year, it doesn’t surprise me
Happy Christmas, I <a href="##" title="avvolgere">wrapped it up</a> and sent it
With a note saying “I love you”, I meant it
Now I know what a <a href="##" title="ingannare">fool</a> I’ve been
But if you kissed me now,
I know you’d <a href="##" title="ingannare">fool</a> me again
Chorus x2
Ooh
Oh, oh, baby
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I’m hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone<a href="##" title="appoggiarsi su">to rely on</a>
Me? I guess I was a <a href="##" title="spalla">shoulder</a> to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you <a href="##" title="distruggere, fare a pezzi">tore me apart</a>
Oh, oh now I’ve found a real love
You’ll never <a href="##" title="ingannare">fool</a> me again
Chorus x2
Special
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
(I gave you mine)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I’ll give it to someone
I’ll give it to someone special
Special
So long</p>
