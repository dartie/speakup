Liam [tore out](## "strappare") the page he’d been writing [on](## "en el límite") and [groaned](## "gemere").
“What’s wr[on](## "en el límite")g with you?” his mother, Rita, asked.
“Ugh! Our English teacher told us to write a story about something paranormal. I can’t think of anything.” He took his ph[on](## "en el límite")e from his bag. “Maybe I can get some ideas [on](## "en el límite")line.”
“Oh no you d[on](## "en el límite")’t!” Rita took the ph[on](## "en el límite")e from him. “You know the rule. No internet while you’re doing homework.”
“Yeah, well, I can’t think of anything.”
“That’s because you spend all your time [on](## "en el límite")line, watching ridiculous videos [on](## "en el límite") TikTok. It’s destroying your imaginati[on](## "en el límite").”
“Oh, [whatever](## "come vuoi, n[on](## "en el límite") importa")! I mean, something paranormal! What a stupid idea! Everybody knows there’s no such thing as the paranormal.”
“D[on](## "en el límite")’t be so sure,” said Rita. “I could tell you a story, but…”
“But what?” asked Liam.
Rita looked at him seriously. “But you’d have to promise me you’d never go to where it happened, especially [on](## "en el límite") the anniversary of the night it happened.”
“What happened?” Liam said, curious [despite](## "n[on](## "en el límite")ostante") his scepticism.
“We’re not sure exactly, but something terrible.” Liam’s family had lived in the town of Kells in County Meath for generati[on](## "en el límite")s and knew all of its secrets. “It was at the Old [Cottage](## "casetta, chalet") [on](## "en el límite") [the edge](## "al limite") of the forest [on](## "en el límite") the night of the winter solstice, the l[on](## "en el límite")gest night of the year. People say [on](## "en el límite") that night every year since, a malevolent spirit returns there and any[on](## "en el límite")e who [ventures](## "avventurarsi") inside risks being possessed by it.”
“Oh, [as if](## "ma per favore!")!” said Liam. “You d[on](## "en el límite")’t believe that, do you?”
“I believe it, because I’ve seen it. What’s more, I’ve heard it. My mother told me the story when I was a teenager and I didn’t listen to her [warning](## "avvertenza"). D[on](## "en el límite")’t make the same mistake I did, Liam.”
Of course, Liam didn’t listen to his mother. He didn’t believe a word of the story, either, but he couldn’t resist going to the Old [Cottage](## "casetta, chalet") to see for himself. 
His parents always went out [on](## "en el límite") the winter solstice to celebrate the occasi[on](## "en el límite") with their friends, and this year was no excepti[on](## "en el límite"). Even though he was thirteen, they insisted [on](## "en el límite") getting a babysitter, an older girl who spent the evening watching films. 
Liam told her he was going to bed early. He then [sneaked out](## "sgattaiolare"), and [met up](## "inc[on](## "en el límite")trarsi") with his best friends Robert and Caoimhe. 
“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” said Caoimhe. Their parents were out celebrating too, and so they’d [sneaked out](## "sgattaiolare") as well.
As they approached the aband[on](## "en el límite")ed house known as the Old [Cottage](## "casetta, chalet"), Liam [shivered](## "tremare"), partly from the cold December air and partly from nerves.
“This place is [creepy](## "inquietante"),” said Caoimhe, sounding as [jittery](## "agitato") as Liam felt.
“It’s why it makes such a good story,” said Liam. “But it’s just that: a story.” He was trying [to reassure](## "rassicurare") himself as much as he was Caoimhe. 
Gathering courage, he [pushed open](## "aprire spingendo") the door of the Old [Cottage](## "casetta, chalet") and entered, using his ph[on](## "en el límite")e for light. “See, nothing here!” he said to his two friends, who were waiting outside. But then he heard it, a groaning sound.
“What’s that?” [whispered](## "sussurrare") Caoimhe, now sounding terrified.
“Oh nothing,” said Liam, trying to sound calm even though his heart was [beating](## "battere") hard. “Just the house… [settling](## "stabilirsi").” It was something he’d heard people say in films. 
There was another groan, and then a terrifying appariti[on](## "en el límite") appeared. Liam screamed and ran outside, and he and his two friends ran all the way back to their homes. 
Rita and her friends [howled](## "ululare") with laughter as the three teenagers disappeared into the darkness.
“Oh, that was fantastic,” she said. “Sean, your groan sounded particularly [creepy](## "inquietante") this year.”
She and the other parents had been coming to the Old [Cottage](## "casetta, chalet") for years, since their [eldest](## "più grande") children had become old enough to be initiated into this l[on](## "en el límite")g-held traditi[on](## "en el límite") – of parents telling that same story to their children and then coming here [to scare](## "spaventare") them [on](## "en el límite") the night of the winter solstice. 
Rita had known Liam would come here; every teenager they told the story to did and they always brought their friends with them. They couldn’t resist.  “Are you sure it wasn’t too much?” asked Sean, sounding a little anxious. “We d[on](## "en el límite")’t want to traumatise them.”
“Nah, it was just enough to revive their imaginati[on](## "en el límite")s. D[on](## "en el límite")’t worry.”
The traditi[on](## "en el límite") had begun as a way to teach children to listen to their parents, but now it was valued for its capacity to inspire their imaginati[on](## "en el límite")s.
One of the other parents, a man called Mikey, agreed. He’d [credited](## "attribuire") his own scare here as a teenager with his career as an animator. “It certainly revived my imaginati[on](## "en el límite"),” he said. “And now kids are growing up too fast, losing themselves in their ph[on](## "en el límite")es and tablets. This traditi[on](## "en el límite") is more important than ever!”
Back home, Liam pulled the [bedcovers](## "coperte") over his head, trying not to cry. The parents didn’t know it, but the entity they’d c[on](## "en el límite")ceived of had become real. [C[on](## "en el límite")jured up](## "evocare") by their imaginati[on](## "en el límite")s, it had grown str[on](## "en el límite")ger each year. Now it was str[on](## "en el límite")g enough to appear to [on](## "en el límite")e of the impressi[on](## "en el límite")able teenagers who visited the Old [Cottage](## "casetta, chalet"); str[on](## "en el límite")g enough to follow him home, and perhaps even to possess him. Just like the story had warned.
