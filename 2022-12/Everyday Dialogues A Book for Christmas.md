**Joe:** Can you help me find a book for my [grandson](## "nipote") for Christmas, please?
**Barbara:** Of course! Do you have any idea of what he is into?
**Joe: **He said a friend sent him recommendations, someone who was ‘making’ him read books. It was a little strange. Tok something?
**Barbara: **Ah, yes, it’s a hashtag, #BookTok. The social media [network](## "rete") TikTok makes recommendations. The kids say, “TikTok made me read it.”
**Joe: **That’s all gobbledygook to me! He gave me a list, but I can’t find it. Which is the most popular one?
**Barbara: **All the must-reads for his age group [are on that display](## "esposti") table over there. And there are some in the Young Adult section on the [shelves](## "scaffali") on the right.
**Joe: **Hmm, ‘Young Adult’… None of them are inappropriate, I hope?
**Barbara: **Well, some genres can be [quite](## "parecchio") [scary](## "terrorífico"), like the post-apocalyptic novels. There are some that [deal](## "trattare") with [sensitive](## "sensibili") [subjects](## "soggetti"), too.
**Joe: **Can you choose a nice, wholesome book for me, please. Nothing controversial.
**Barbara: **I think you’ll like this one, then. It’s science fiction, a best-seller.
**Joe: **Yes, OK, I’ll take that one. Can you gift-wrap it, please?
