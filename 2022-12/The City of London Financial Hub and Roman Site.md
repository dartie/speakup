# The City of London: Financial Hub and Roman Site   [B2]

È uno dei centri finanziari più importanti al mondo, un distretto che gode di uno status speciale nella capitale britannica, il cui orizzonte si contraddistingue per i moderni grattacieli. Ma è anche il luogo dove i romani costruirono le fondamenta di Londinium, un’eredità storica che continua ad essere molto presente.

The City of London is a place of contrasts. This small district in the heart of the British capital is [second only to](## "seconda solo a") New York as the most important financial [hub](## "centro") in the world, generating nearly £[bn](## "miliardi")70 in economic [output](## "produzione") annually. Located to the south of the River Thames, the City features [skyscrapers](## "grattacieli") and [state-of-the-art](## "all’avanguardia") buildings that define London’s skyline. It is also the oldest part of the capital, the site where the Romans [laid the foundations](## "porre le fondamenta") of Londinium, a port town of strategic importance, in the mid-1st century.

## roman walls
The [boundaries](## "limiti, frontiere") of the historic town were established by a 2.5 mile-long defensive wall, little of which remains today. The best-preserved surviving sections of the London Wall can be seen just outside the entrance to Tower Hill tube station, although only the [lower](## "inferiore") section dates from the Roman age; the [upper](## "superiore") part was built in medieval times.

## money and architecture
Colloquially known as the Square Mile, because it covers an area of 1.12 square miles (2.90 km2), the City is the location of the Bank of England and the London [Stock Exchange](## "borsa valori, borsa finanziaria"), the world’s biggest international banking and [foreign exchange market](## "mercato delle divise"). It also contains [branches](## "filiali") of all the major investment banks and [trading firms](## "società di commercio di strumenti finanziari"). Its oldest and most visited [landmarks](## "attrazioni più frequentate") include London Bridge and the Tower of London, St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Monument to the Great Fire of London. The City is also home to the newest architecture in Britain. A number of its [skyscrapers](## "grattacieli") are tourist attractions and some have been given [nicknames](## "soprannomi") based on their unusual forms, such as the [Gherkin](## "cetriolini"), the Walkie-Talkie or the [Cheesegrater](## "grattugia").
The City is unique because, despite being one of the thirty-two [boroughs](## "quartieri") that constitute Greater London, it has its own government, its own [mayor](## "sindaco") (the Lord Mayor) and its own independent police force. The City also collects its own [taxes](## "tasse") and has its own flag, which is similar to that of England, although the well-known red cross of St. George on a white background also features a red [sword](## "spada") on its [[upper](## "superiore") left corner](## "angolo superiore sinistro").

## silver and red dragons
You can, of course, easily see the district’s [boundaries](## "limiti, frontiere") on Google Maps. But another quick way to find out if you have entered the City is to look at street [signs](## "cartelli"). Each sign in the City states “City of London” and depicts its [coat of arms](## "stemma"). [Furthermore](## "inoltre"), thirteen distinctive statues of silver and red dragons surround the City, and will also always let you know when you are within its borders.
