BookTok is a community on the app TikTok whose creators make videos reacting to books they have read. #Booktok formed during the pandemic as a way of [dealing](## "affrontare") with quarantine [boredom](## "noia"). It quickly [caught on](## "prendere piede, diventare di moda"), with some posts attracting millions of views and many more inspiring young readers. Today, #BookTok has become a powerful force in the [publishing](## "editoriale") world, helping to create some of the market’s best-sellers.

## young adults
#BookTok influencers tend to be in the generation Z age group (approximately nine to twenty-four) and for this reason young adult (YA) fiction has received particular attention. Big hits include Heartstopper, four graphic LGBTQ coming-of-age novels by Alice Oseman that are now a successful series on Netflix. Elena Armas’ debut romcom The Spanish Love [Deception](## "inganno"), now published in over twenty-five languages, is the latest YA novel to transition from #BookTok to big screen. 

## CLASSIC MAKEOVERS 
However, #BookTok is now [boosting](## "rinvigorire") adult fiction, too. Madeline Miller’s The Song of Achilles, a love story based on Homer’s Iliad, sold two million copies after [taking off](## "decollare") on TikTok ten years after its publication. Even [timeless](## "senza tempo") classics like Emily Brontë’s [Wuthering Heights](## "Cime tempestose") (1847) and F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925) are causing excitement, while a post calling James Joyce’s Ulysses (1922) “really [weird](## "strano")” to a sample of Johann Bach’s first cello suite amassed 27,000 likes.

## LITERARY CRITICISM
TikTok creators understand that creating a sixty-second video inspired by what they are reading is [reductive](## "riduttivo, insufficiente"). Many videos, therefore, are a [teaser](## "occhiata") for a written review or reflect critically on the literary world as a whole. Some of the funniest [mock](## "deridere") literary [tropes](## "clichés"), such as “How white people write East Asian women”, or “Which dress are you wearing to run romantically through a castle to your lover?”

## WORD OF MOUTH
Publishers and bookstores are excited by BookTok’s impact on sales. Many put a selection of BookTok trending titles on display or send books directly to influencers to review. However, as some authors have discovered, no one #BookTok influencer can make a book a best-seller: it takes a whole community of users [to spread](## "diffondere") the word — which is, of course, the oldest form of promotion.
