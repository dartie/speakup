Kwanzaa is a [week-long](## "che dura una settimana") celebration of African-American culture, which takes place from 26 December to 1 January. Kwanzaa was conceived to reconnect African-Americans to their African [roots](## "radici"). Years of [enslavement](## "schiavitù") had left them without knowledge of their past. New rituals based on African traditions created a sense of [belonging](## "appartenenza") and community. The holiday [fostered](## "incoraggiare, promuovere") unity, [pride](## "orgoglio") and hope for the future.

## principles
The holiday was created in 1966 by Maulana Karenga, a professor and [chairman](## "presidente") of Black Studies at California State University. He was persuaded by his experience of  the Watts [riots](## "rivolte") in Los Angeles in 1965, which he believed [highlighted](## "evidenziare") racial division in the United States. Karenga’s [aim](## "obiettivo") was [to outline](## "delineare, tracciare") “a necessary minimum set of principles by which Black people must live in order to begin to rescue and reconstruct our history and lives.”

## seven days 
The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase “mutanda ya kwanza”, which means ‘first fruits’. An extra ‘a’ was added to make it a seven-letter word, as the number seven is significant in Kwanzaa philosophy. Kwanzaa has seven days, seven principles and seven symbols. On each of the days, families get together [to light](## "accendere") a candle and discuss the principle of the day. The symbols are used to create a Kwanzaa set used in the daily rituals. The set [comprises](## "includere") fruits, vegetables and [nuts](## "frutti secchi, noccioline"); a [straw mat](## "stuoia di paglia"); [ears of corn](## "pannocchie di mais") representing fertility; seven [candles](## "candele") in the African colours of red, green and black; a [candleholder](## "porta candele"); a communal cup; and gifts. 

## being human
Kwanzaa is now celebrated by millions of people around the world. People from other ethnicities are also [encouraged](## "incoraggiare") to take part. In the words of the founder: “Kwanzaa brings a cultural message which speaks to the best of what it means to be African and human in the [fullest](## "più totale") sense.”

## The seven principles  of Kwanzaa
**Umoja (unity)**[To strive](## "impegnarsi") for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation and race.
**Ujima (collective work and responsibility)**
To build and maintain our community together and make our brothers’ and sisters’ problems our problems and to solve them together.
**Kujichagulia (self-determination) **
To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves and speak for ourselves.
**Ujimaa (cooperative economics)**
To build and maintain our own stores and other businesses and to [profit](## "profitto") from them together.
**Nia ([purpose](## "scopo"))**
To make our collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order [to restore](## "restituire") our people to their greatness.
**Kuumba (creativity)**
To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we [inherited](## "ereditare") it.
**Imani (faith) **
To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders and the [righteousness](## "virtù, onestà") and victory of our [struggle](## "lotta").
