The most famous writer in English in the world, William Shakespeare has a unique position in global literature. The [worldwide](## "mundiale") reputation of the [Bard](## "bardo (arcaico), poeta") of Avon came from a number of [plays](## "opere teatrali") written more than four centuries ago and [performed](## "recitare, rappresentare") in a small London theatre. [And yet](## "comunque") his contemporary, the [playwright](## "drammaturgo") Ben Jonson, made one of the most [accurate](## "precise") predictions of all time when he said that Shakespeare “was not of an [age](## "epoca") but for all time”.

## A witty rebel
We have very little information about this master of English, with just a few official documents and [not even a single](## "neanche uno") manuscript written in his hand. He [never even](## "mai neanche") [spelt](## "scrivere") his own name as William Shakespeare. He [left](## "lasciare") no diaries and no direct descendants, as he had no [great-grandchildren](## "pronipoti"). 

## Married at Eighteen
Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. He married at eighteen. His wife, Anne Hathaway, [age](## "epoca")d twenty-six, was already [pregnant](## "incinta"). The [couple](## "coppia") had three children. And then our information [dries up](## "esaurire") for eight years. These are Shakespeare’s [so-called](## "cosiddetti") ‘Lost Years’. We then find the writer in London, where he [spends](## "dedicare") the next twenty years devoting his life to his art, writing more than one million words of poetic drama of the highest quality. 

## Plays, Poems and Sonnets
Shakespeare wrote a total of thirty-nine [plays](## "opere teatrali"), 154 sonnets and three narrative poems. Critics have divided the [plays](## "opere teatrali") into tr[age](## "epoca")dies, comedies and tragicomedies (or romances). The titles are famous all over the world and include Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, A Midsummer’s Night Dream and The [Merchant](## "mercante") of Venice. He was “a writer of great intellectual rapidity, [perceptiveness](## "perspicacia, sagacità") and poetic power.”

## Endlessly Quoted
Shakespeare’s works are the second [most-quoted](## "più citato") after the Bible. He is the author of 10 per cent of the [most-quoted](## "più citato") [lines](## "frasi") in English. His line “To be or not to be” is the most famous phrase in world literature. The most influential writer in the English langu[age](## "epoca"), he introduced more than 1,700 original words — [such as](## "come per esempio") ‘lonely’, ‘frugal’ and ‘[dwindle](## "diminuire, affievolirsi")’ — into English. Eighty of his phrases, [such as](## "come per esempio") ‘breaking the ice’ and ‘heart of gold’, are still [in current use](## "di uso comune oggigiorno"). His work has influenced not just the world’s literature but also art, music and even psychiatry.


>To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outr[age](## "epoca")ous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heartache 




## Poetic Personality
At the [age](## "epoca") of forty-nine, Shakespeare retired to Stratford-upon-Avon. He died just three years later. He is England’s national [playwright](## "drammaturgo") but we know almost nothing of his character. Ben Jonson, the greatest of his contemporaries, called him “Sweet [Swan](## "cigno") of Avon” and said that his personality was in his poetry, that “the style was the man.” Jonson knew that he was in the presence of genius: Shakespeare was the “[Soul](## "anima") of the [age](## "epoca"), the applause, [delight](## "piacere"), the [wonder](## "meraviglia") of our st[age](## "epoca")”. Wonderful words for the greatest writer in the English langu[age](## "epoca").
