<p>The most famous writer in English in the world, William Shakespeare has a unique position in global literature. The <a href="##" title="mundiale">worldwide</a> reputation of the <a href="##" title="bardo (arcaico), poeta">Bard</a> of Avon came from a number of <a href="##" title="opere teatrali">plays</a> written more than four centuries ago and <a href="##" title="recitare, rappresentare">performed</a> in a small London theatre. <a href="##" title="comunque">And yet</a> his contemporary, the <a href="##" title="drammaturgo">playwright</a> Ben Jonson, made one of the most <a href="##" title="precise">accurate</a> predictions of all time when he said that Shakespeare “was not of an <a href="##" title="epoca">age</a> but for all time”.</p>

<h2 id="a-witty-rebel">A witty rebel</h2>

<p>We have very little information about this master of English, with just a few official documents and <a href="##" title="neanche uno">not even a single</a> manuscript written in his hand. He <a href="##" title="mai neanche">never even</a> <a href="##" title="scrivere">spelt</a> his own name as William Shakespeare. He <a href="##" title="lasciare">left</a> no diaries and no direct descendants, as he had no <a href="##" title="pronipoti">great-grandchildren</a>. </p>

<h2 id="married-at-eighteen">Married at Eighteen</h2>

<p>Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. He married at eighteen. His wife, Anne Hathaway, <a href="##" title="epoca">age</a>d twenty-six, was already <a href="##" title="incinta">pregnant</a>. The <a href="##" title="coppia">couple</a> had three children. And then our information <a href="##" title="esaurire">dries up</a> for eight years. These are Shakespeare’s <a href="##" title="cosiddetti">so-called</a> ‘Lost Years’. We then find the writer in London, where he <a href="##" title="dedicare">spends</a> the next twenty years devoting his life to his art, writing more than one million words of poetic drama of the highest quality. </p>

<h2 id="plays-poems-and-sonnets">Plays, Poems and Sonnets</h2>

<p>Shakespeare wrote a total of thirty-nine <a href="##" title="opere teatrali">plays</a>, 154 sonnets and three narrative poems. Critics have divided the <a href="##" title="opere teatrali">plays</a> into tr<a href="##" title="epoca">age</a>dies, comedies and tragicomedies (or romances). The titles are famous all over the world and include Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, A Midsummer’s Night Dream and The <a href="##" title="mercante">Merchant</a> of Venice. He was “a writer of great intellectual rapidity, <a href="##" title="perspicacia, sagacità">perceptiveness</a> and poetic power.”</p>

<h2 id="endlessly-quoted">Endlessly Quoted</h2>

<p>Shakespeare’s works are the second <a href="##" title="più citato">most-quoted</a> after the Bible. He is the author of 10 per cent of the <a href="##" title="più citato">most-quoted</a> <a href="##" title="frasi">lines</a> in English. His line “To be or not to be” is the most famous phrase in world literature. The most influential writer in the English langu<a href="##" title="epoca">age</a>, he introduced more than 1,700 original words — <a href="##" title="come per esempio">such as</a> ‘lonely’, ‘frugal’ and ‘<a href="##" title="diminuire, affievolirsi">dwindle</a>’ — into English. Eighty of his phrases, <a href="##" title="come per esempio">such as</a> ‘breaking the ice’ and ‘heart of gold’, are still <a href="##" title="di uso comune oggigiorno">in current use</a>. His work has influenced not just the world’s literature but also art, music and even psychiatry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outr<a href="##" title="epoca">age</a>ous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; no more; and by a sleep to say we end the heartache </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="poetic-personality">Poetic Personality</h2>

<p>At the <a href="##" title="epoca">age</a> of forty-nine, Shakespeare retired to Stratford-upon-Avon. He died just three years later. He is England’s national <a href="##" title="drammaturgo">playwright</a> but we know almost nothing of his character. Ben Jonson, the greatest of his contemporaries, called him “Sweet <a href="##" title="cigno">Swan</a> of Avon” and said that his personality was in his poetry, that “the style was the man.” Jonson knew that he was in the presence of genius: Shakespeare was the “<a href="##" title="anima">Soul</a> of the <a href="##" title="epoca">age</a>, the applause, <a href="##" title="piacere">delight</a>, the <a href="##" title="meraviglia">wonder</a> of our st<a href="##" title="epoca">age</a>”. Wonderful words for the greatest writer in the English langu<a href="##" title="epoca">age</a>.</p>
