<p>Liam <a href="##" title="strappare">tore out</a> the page he’d been writing <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> and <a href="##" title="gemere">groaned</a>.
“What’s wr<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>g with you?” his mother, Rita, asked.
“Ugh! Our English teacher told us to write a story about something paranormal. I can’t think of anything.” He took his ph<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>e from his bag. “Maybe I can get some ideas <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>line.”
“Oh no you d<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>’t!” Rita took the ph<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>e from him. “You know the rule. No internet while you’re doing homework.”
“Yeah, well, I can’t think of anything.”
“That’s because you spend all your time <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>line, watching ridiculous videos <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> TikTok. It’s destroying your imaginati<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>.”
“Oh, <a href="##" title="come vuoi, n[on](## &quot;en el límite">whatever</a> importa&rdquo;)! I mean, something paranormal! What a stupid idea! Everybody knows there’s no such thing as the paranormal.”
“D<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>’t be so sure,” said Rita. “I could tell you a story, but…”
“But what?” asked Liam.
Rita looked at him seriously. “But you’d have to promise me you’d never go to where it happened, especially <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> the anniversary of the night it happened.”
“What happened?” Liam said, curious <a href="##" title="n[on](## &quot;en el límite">despite</a>ostante&rdquo;) his scepticism.
“We’re not sure exactly, but something terrible.” Liam’s family had lived in the town of Kells in County Meath for generati<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>s and knew all of its secrets. “It was at the Old <a href="##" title="casetta, chalet">Cottage</a> <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> <a href="##" title="al limite">the edge</a> of the forest <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> the night of the winter solstice, the l<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>gest night of the year. People say <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> that night every year since, a malevolent spirit returns there and any<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>e who <a href="##" title="avventurarsi">ventures</a> inside risks being possessed by it.”
“Oh, <a href="##" title="ma per favore!">as if</a>!” said Liam. “You d<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>’t believe that, do you?”
“I believe it, because I’ve seen it. What’s more, I’ve heard it. My mother told me the story when I was a teenager and I didn’t listen to her <a href="##" title="avvertenza">warning</a>. D<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>’t make the same mistake I did, Liam.”
Of course, Liam didn’t listen to his mother. He didn’t believe a word of the story, either, but he couldn’t resist going to the Old <a href="##" title="casetta, chalet">Cottage</a> to see for himself. 
His parents always went out <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> the winter solstice to celebrate the occasi<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> with their friends, and this year was no excepti<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>. Even though he was thirteen, they insisted <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> getting a babysitter, an older girl who spent the evening watching films. 
Liam told her he was going to bed early. He then <a href="##" title="sgattaiolare">sneaked out</a>, and <a href="##" title="inc[on](## &quot;en el límite">met up</a>trarsi&rdquo;) with his best friends Robert and Caoimhe. 
“I can’t believe we’re doing this,” said Caoimhe. Their parents were out celebrating too, and so they’d <a href="##" title="sgattaiolare">sneaked out</a> as well.
As they approached the aband<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>ed house known as the Old <a href="##" title="casetta, chalet">Cottage</a>, Liam <a href="##" title="tremare">shivered</a>, partly from the cold December air and partly from nerves.
“This place is <a href="##" title="inquietante">creepy</a>,” said Caoimhe, sounding as <a href="##" title="agitato">jittery</a> as Liam felt.
“It’s why it makes such a good story,” said Liam. “But it’s just that: a story.” He was trying <a href="##" title="rassicurare">to reassure</a> himself as much as he was Caoimhe. 
Gathering courage, he <a href="##" title="aprire spingendo">pushed open</a> the door of the Old <a href="##" title="casetta, chalet">Cottage</a> and entered, using his ph<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>e for light. “See, nothing here!” he said to his two friends, who were waiting outside. But then he heard it, a groaning sound.
“What’s that?” <a href="##" title="sussurrare">whispered</a> Caoimhe, now sounding terrified.
“Oh nothing,” said Liam, trying to sound calm even though his heart was <a href="##" title="battere">beating</a> hard. “Just the house… <a href="##" title="stabilirsi">settling</a>.” It was something he’d heard people say in films. 
There was another groan, and then a terrifying appariti<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> appeared. Liam screamed and ran outside, and he and his two friends ran all the way back to their homes. 
Rita and her friends <a href="##" title="ululare">howled</a> with laughter as the three teenagers disappeared into the darkness.
“Oh, that was fantastic,” she said. “Sean, your groan sounded particularly <a href="##" title="inquietante">creepy</a> this year.”
She and the other parents had been coming to the Old <a href="##" title="casetta, chalet">Cottage</a> for years, since their <a href="##" title="più grande">eldest</a> children had become old enough to be initiated into this l<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>g-held traditi<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> – of parents telling that same story to their children and then coming here <a href="##" title="spaventare">to scare</a> them <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> the night of the winter solstice. 
Rita had known Liam would come here; every teenager they told the story to did and they always brought their friends with them. They couldn’t resist.  “Are you sure it wasn’t too much?” asked Sean, sounding a little anxious. “We d<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>’t want to traumatise them.”
“Nah, it was just enough to revive their imaginati<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>s. D<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>’t worry.”
The traditi<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> had begun as a way to teach children to listen to their parents, but now it was valued for its capacity to inspire their imaginati<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>s.
One of the other parents, a man called Mikey, agreed. He’d <a href="##" title="attribuire">credited</a> his own scare here as a teenager with his career as an animator. “It certainly revived my imaginati<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>,” he said. “And now kids are growing up too fast, losing themselves in their ph<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>es and tablets. This traditi<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a> is more important than ever!”
Back home, Liam pulled the <a href="##" title="coperte">bedcovers</a> over his head, trying not to cry. The parents didn’t know it, but the entity they’d c<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>ceived of had become real. <a href="##" title="evocare">C<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>jured up</a> by their imaginati<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>s, it had grown str<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>ger each year. Now it was str<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>g enough to appear to <a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>e of the impressi<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>able teenagers who visited the Old <a href="##" title="casetta, chalet">Cottage</a>; str<a href="##" title="en el límite">on</a>g enough to follow him home, and perhaps even to possess him. Just like the story had warned.</p>
