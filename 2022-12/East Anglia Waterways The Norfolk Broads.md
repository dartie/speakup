# East Anglia Waterways: The Norfolk Broads   [B2]

Questo labirinto di fiumi, laghi e canali navigabili vicino alla costa dell’East Anglia è uno dei parchi nazionali più singolari della Gran Bretagna. Il suo bellissimo paesaggio, pieno di chiese e mulini a vento, possiede un’enorme varietà di fauna e di flora.

The Broads National Park is on England’s East Coast, close to the North Sea. Extending like a watery web around the city of Norwich, it is Britain’s largest nationally-protected [wetland](## "zone umide"). Also known as the Norfolk Broads (even though it crosses into the neighbouring county of Suffolk), the area comprises more than sixty lakes, known locally as ‘broads’, [linked](## "unire") by seven main rivers and their tributaries. This is a magical land of [meadow](## "prato"), [marsh](## "palude"), [reedbeds](## "canneto"), [fenland](## "palude"), [woodland](## "bosco"), and, of course, broads... 

## [peat digging](## "estrazione della torba")
Until 1960, most experts assumed that the Broads were a natural [geographical feature](## "caratteristica geografica"). However, research confirmed that they were actually the result of [peat digging](## "estrazione della torba") for fuel during the medieval period. When rising sea levels filled the peat [pits](## "fosse, cave") in the 14th century, they created a series of [shallow](## "poco profondo") lakes. Most of the broads are less than four metres deep. 

## WINDMILLS AND PUMPS
The towers of ancient churches rise above the water, while iconic [windmills](## "mulini a vento") with giant [[sail](## "navigare")s](## "vele") punctuate the Broads’ landscape. They were once used to [corn](## "mais") [grind](## "macinare") and [flour](## "farina"), or as [wind pumps](## "pompe eoliche") [to drain](## "drenare") water from the [meadow](## "prato")s where farm animals [grazed](## "pascolare"). As technology changed and drainage systems became modernised, many mills and pumps [fell into disrepair](## "essere abbandonati"). Some were later restored. 

## BOATING AND LEISURE
During the 19th century, visitors [flocked](## "accorrere") to the area for [recreational boating.](## "navigazione ricreativa") The first [leisure](## "di svago") boats were made available for hire in 1878. The tradition continues to this day, with eight million visitors coming to the Broads for this reason every year.
There are no [locks](## "serrature") to navigate in the Broads, making it easy to cruise, [sail](## "navigare") or paddle from one waterway to the next. Out on the water, the only sounds are the [whispering](## "sussurrare") of the reeds, the distant call of birds and the gentle [slapping](## "colpire") of waves against the [hull](## "scafo") of the boat. On land, a network of [footpaths](## "sentieri") [criss-cross](## "incrociare") the 303-square-kilometres of the vast [flat](## "piatto") [parkland](## "area verde"). It is a [mesmerising](## "affascinante") and mysterious place that feels both protected and exposed beneath immense skies.

## TRADE ROUTE
The Broads waterways were once part of a busy trade route, with [wherries](## "battelli") — wooden [barges](## "galleggianti") with large [canvas](## "tela") [[sail](## "navigare")s](## "vele") — carrying [goods](## "merce") to and from the coastal ports. The last trading wherry was built in 1912, but some of these distinctive [crafts](## "imbarcazioni") can still be seen on the Broads today. The Broads are [tidal](## "legati alla marea"), and the largest areas of water are Hickling Broad and Barton Broad to the north and Breydon Water to the east, near the holiday resort of Great Yarmouth. There is a strict speed limit on all waterways to prevent boats creating waves and damaging the river [banks](## "rive"). Whatever the purpose, travelling on the tranquil Broads today first requires slowing down.
