April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") Day, which occurs on 1 April in many countries around the world, is a day for jokes and [pranks](## "scherzi"), but nobody knows for sure how it started. However, there are several theories of its origins. One theory connects the day to the [joyful](## "allegro") ancient Roman festival Hilaria, celebrated on 25 March in honour of Cybele, the Mother of Gods, with games, masquerades, and [mockery](## "burle") to welcome the arrival of spring. Other festivals, such as the two-day Hindu Holi, the Persian Sizdah Bedar, and the Jewish Purim, also focus on joy and fun during spring. However, there is no solid evidence [linking](## "collegare") April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") Day to these so-called ‘renewal festivals’. A common [trait](## "caratteristica") of these festivals is that during these events, the social order is suspended: servants or children temporarily challenge the authority of masters, parents and teachers. Afterwards, order is reaffirmed and the stability of society is [restored](## "ristabilire"). 

## MEDIEVAL OR RENAISSANCE
Hypotheses about April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") Day also include links to medieval literature, as some see a [glimpse](## "barlume, assaggio") of April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") Day in Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales (1392): in one of the stories, a [vain](## "vanitoso") [cock](## "gallo") is [tricked](## "ingannare") by a [fox](## "volpe"), and the event seemingly occurs on 1 April.
A very popular theory connects April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") Day to the 16th century, when the Christian world adopted the Gregorian calendar. Before this change, the new year was celebrated around 1 April. When the calendar shifted to make 1 January  the start of the year, people who continued to observe it in April were mocked as April fools. 
The first definite mention of April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") Day comes from a 1561 [Flemish](## "fiammingo") poem that describes a nobleman tricking his servant on 1 April, sending him on [meaningless](## "insensato") tasks. By the 17th century, the tradition was so widely [spread](## "diffondersi") that on 1 April serious events were sometimes dated differently to prevent any possible confusion. It seems that the Treaty of Warsaw (1683) had [to be backdated](## "retrodatare") to 31 March!

## DIFFERENT TRADITIONS
Different countries developed unique traditions for April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") Day. For instance, in Italy and France people [pin](## "attaccare") paper fish on others’ backs while [shouting](## "gridare") “Pesce d’aprile!”, or “Poisson d’avril!”. The expression is probably linked to fish being plentiful and hungry in the spring, making them easy [to catch](## "catturare"): the April fish is more [gullible](## "credulone, boccalone") than at other times of the year. In Scotland, the day was known as Taily Day, with reference to a pig’s [tail](## "coda"), and a “Kick me” sign placed on someone’s back became a common prank. In Ireland, people played practical jokes by sending someone to deliver a note that read “Send the fool [further](## "più lontano").”

## WHAT’S SO FUNNY?
Not everyone loves April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") Day, though. Pranks can feel annoying or even mean, especially if they embarrass someone or go too far. Besides, in the age of the internet, April [Fools’](## "sciocchi, stupidi") jokes sometimes add to the [flood](## "inondazione") of fake news, leaving people disorientated or [misinformed](## "disinformata"). April Fools' Day has, in fact, [swiftly](## "rapidamente") evolved in recent times, with the rise of social media and mass communication amplifying its [reach](## "portata"). What was once a tradition of personal [pranks](## "scherzi") has now expanded to large-scale jokes, often shared by [media outlets](## "mezzi di comunicazione") and online platforms, making it a global event where [pranks](## "scherzi") can go viral.
