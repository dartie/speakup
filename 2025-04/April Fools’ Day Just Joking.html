<p>April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> Day, which occurs on 1 April in many countries around the world, is a day for jokes and <a href="##" title="scherzi">pranks</a>, but nobody knows for sure how it started. However, there are several theories of its origins. One theory connects the day to the <a href="##" title="allegro">joyful</a> ancient Roman festival Hilaria, celebrated on 25 March in honour of Cybele, the Mother of Gods, with games, masquerades, and <a href="##" title="burle">mockery</a> to welcome the arrival of spring. Other festivals, such as the two-day Hindu Holi, the Persian Sizdah Bedar, and the Jewish Purim, also focus on joy and fun during spring. However, there is no solid evidence <a href="##" title="collegare">linking</a> April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> Day to these so-called ‘renewal festivals’. A common <a href="##" title="caratteristica">trait</a> of these festivals is that during these events, the social order is suspended: servants or children temporarily challenge the authority of masters, parents and teachers. Afterwards, order is reaffirmed and the stability of society is <a href="##" title="ristabilire">restored</a>. </p>

<h2 id="medieval-or-renaissance">MEDIEVAL OR RENAISSANCE</h2>

<p>Hypotheses about April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> Day also include links to medieval literature, as some see a <a href="##" title="barlume, assaggio">glimpse</a> of April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> Day in Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales (1392): in one of the stories, a <a href="##" title="vanitoso">vain</a> <a href="##" title="gallo">cock</a> is <a href="##" title="ingannare">tricked</a> by a <a href="##" title="volpe">fox</a>, and the event seemingly occurs on 1 April.
A very popular theory connects April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> Day to the 16th century, when the Christian world adopted the Gregorian calendar. Before this change, the new year was celebrated around 1 April. When the calendar shifted to make 1 January  the start of the year, people who continued to observe it in April were mocked as April fools. 
The first definite mention of April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> Day comes from a 1561 <a href="##" title="fiammingo">Flemish</a> poem that describes a nobleman tricking his servant on 1 April, sending him on <a href="##" title="insensato">meaningless</a> tasks. By the 17th century, the tradition was so widely <a href="##" title="diffondersi">spread</a> that on 1 April serious events were sometimes dated differently to prevent any possible confusion. It seems that the Treaty of Warsaw (1683) had <a href="##" title="retrodatare">to be backdated</a> to 31 March!</p>

<h2 id="different-traditions">DIFFERENT TRADITIONS</h2>

<p>Different countries developed unique traditions for April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> Day. For instance, in Italy and France people <a href="##" title="attaccare">pin</a> paper fish on others’ backs while <a href="##" title="gridare">shouting</a> “Pesce d’aprile!”, or “Poisson d’avril!”. The expression is probably linked to fish being plentiful and hungry in the spring, making them easy <a href="##" title="catturare">to catch</a>: the April fish is more <a href="##" title="credulone, boccalone">gullible</a> than at other times of the year. In Scotland, the day was known as Taily Day, with reference to a pig’s <a href="##" title="coda">tail</a>, and a “Kick me” sign placed on someone’s back became a common prank. In Ireland, people played practical jokes by sending someone to deliver a note that read “Send the fool <a href="##" title="più lontano">further</a>.”</p>

<h2 id="what-s-so-funny">WHAT’S SO FUNNY?</h2>

<p>Not everyone loves April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> Day, though. Pranks can feel annoying or even mean, especially if they embarrass someone or go too far. Besides, in the age of the internet, April <a href="##" title="sciocchi, stupidi">Fools’</a> jokes sometimes add to the <a href="##" title="inondazione">flood</a> of fake news, leaving people disorientated or <a href="##" title="disinformata">misinformed</a>. April Fools&rsquo; Day has, in fact, <a href="##" title="rapidamente">swiftly</a> evolved in recent times, with the rise of social media and mass communication amplifying its <a href="##" title="portata">reach</a>. What was once a tradition of personal <a href="##" title="scherzi">pranks</a> has now expanded to large-scale jokes, often shared by <a href="##" title="mezzi di comunicazione">media outlets</a> and online platforms, making it a global event where <a href="##" title="scherzi">pranks</a> can go viral.
