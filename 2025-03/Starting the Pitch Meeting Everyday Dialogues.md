Katia: Well, we are very selective about the [partners](## "soci") we work with and everyone we spoke to recommended we talk to you.
Michel: Great! We know there are a lot of agencies in this sector, so we appreciate the opportunity to show you our credentials and give you an idea of how we work,
Katia: We are [eager](## "ansiosi") to see what you can do for us.

Katia: It’s not an easy market to break into.
Michel: No, but we have a few proposals that will help you differentiate yourselves.
