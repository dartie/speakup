<p>I have been a <a href="##" title="sfuggente">slippery</a> character since the day I was born. Seconds after the <a href="##" title="ostetrica">midwife</a> cut the umbilical cord, <a href="##" title="contorcersi">I wriggled</a>, <a href="##" title="sfuggire">slipped out</a> of her hands and fell to the floor. Fortunately I was born at home; I owe my life to the thick <a href="##" title="tappeto">carpet</a> in my parents’ bedroom.
My parents could never hug or <a href="##" title="fare il solletico">tickle</a> me. Throwing me into the air and catching me was completely out of the question. Their inability to show their affection in any tangible way worried them. They took me to a child psychologist, but by that time I’d invented an explanation for my behaviour, which convinced everyone.
I was never involved in any physical altercations at school. I enjoyed provoking the <a href="##" title="bulli, prepotenti">school bullies</a>, but while they tried to <a href="##" title="picchiare">beat me up</a> I always <a href="##" title="sfuggire">slipped out</a> from their rugby-style <a href="##" title="placcaggi">tackles</a> like a bar of soap. I had few friends and was equally unpopular with the staff. If the teachers tried to reprimand me for a <a href="##" title="impertinente">cheeky</a> comment or incomplete homework, they soon discovered that my tongue was as <a href="##" title="sfuggente">slippery</a> as the rest of me. My <a href="##" title="rapide, pronte">ready</a> excuses and explanations left them in <a href="##" title="sbalordito, confuso">bewildered</a> silence.
I didn’t bother with university, but went straight from school to a job, several in fact, and I moved between my various roles — <a href="##" title="barista">bartender</a>, <a href="##" title="postina">courier</a>, circus escapologist and part-time thief — with the greatest of <a href="##" title="facilità, con disinvoltura">ease</a>. I signed no contracts and paid no taxes. I gave a false name and address to each of my employers, so if ever I had to leave suddenly, they were unable <a href="##" title="prendere">to get hold of</a> me. 
All that changed the day I saw Bernard. Sitting at a small table in the corner of the restaurant where I was working as a waiter, he was one of the few single <a href="##" title="commensali">diners</a> not <a href="##" title="guardare da vicino, scrutare">peering</a> at a smartphone. A large man — not fat, but robust and imposing — Bernard looked neither <a href="##" title="goffo">awkward</a> nor isolated. Although I wasn’t his waiter that evening, I frequently noticed him watching me. If our eyes crossed, he smiled and looked away. At the end of the meal he <a href="##" title="chiamare">summoned</a> another waiter and <a href="##" title="pagare il conto">settled his bill</a>, but then passed close by me as he headed for the exit. I was so sure he was going to stop and say something, I raised my <a href="##" title="sopracciglia">eyebrows</a> and looked at him expectantly, but he walked past me and out onto the street. I felt <a href="##" title="stupida">foolish</a> and <a href="##" title="infastidita">annoyed</a>. I thought about him all that evening and most of the next day. 
Bernard came back three or four times and the same thing happened. Whenever I caught him looking, he would smile and look away. The worst thing was, I felt strangely <a href="##" title="attratta">drawn</a> to him. I, who had spent a lifetime <a href="##" title="sfuggire">slipping away</a> from people, felt an irresistible urge not only to approach him, but to get to know him. It was a fierce magnetism.
Eventually I could <a href="##" title="non potevo più sopportarli">stand it no longer</a>. The last time he left, I <a href="##" title="uscire di fretta">hurried out</a> of the restaurant just in time to see him disappearing down an <a href="##" title="strada">alley</a>. I ran after him, but when I got to the <a href="##" title="strada">alley</a> it was deserted. I was fast on my feet, but this large man had managed to <a href="##" title="avanzare">outstrip</a> me. I started jogging down the <a href="##" title="strada">alley</a> when suddenly a great hand grabbed me by the neck and <a href="##" title="alzare da terra">lifted me off my feet</a>. That’s when Bernard introduced himself. I squirmed and kicked but he’d <a href="##" title="prendere">trapped</a> some of my hair in his fist and I couldn’t move without <a href="##" title="strattonare">wrenching</a> it at the <a href="##" title="radici">roots</a>. 
“I wouldn’t waste too much effort trying to wriggle out of this one,” he said in a voice that was deep and strangely calming. “There are some people who’d like to have a word with you.”
“Who?” I <a href="##" title="ansimare">gasped</a>.
Bernard recited a long list of names: all people I’d robbed or <a href="##" title="truffare">swindled</a> and then slipped away from. They’d <a href="##" title="contattare">reached out</a> to each other on social media, sharing old photographs of me in various <a href="##" title="maschere">guises</a> before hiring Bernard to track me down. 
Bernard forced me to his car.
“You won’t mind travelling in the back,”  he said softly as he opened the <a href="##" title="bagagliaio">boot</a>. I shook my head and he <a href="##" title="soffocare">gagged</a> and tied me up, then lifted me in with surprising gentleness. I wasn’t worried — I’d escaped from similar situations several times in one of my circus jobs. 
Poor Bernard really thought that leaving me tied up in the <a href="##" title="bagagliaio">boot</a> of his car in a locked garage would be enough to control me until his clients arrived. I watched them from the roof of a neighbouring garage as they <a href="##" title="fare una fila">lined up</a>, waiting expectantly. I felt truly sorry for Bernard as he opened the garage door, then flung the <a href="##" title="aprire di colpo"><a href="##" title="bagagliaio">boot</a> open</a>, only to find it empty.
But Bernard has me well and truly <a href="##" title="prendere">trapped</a>. I moved away and found another job, but I still feel irresistibly <a href="##" title="attratta">drawn</a> to the calm and <a href="##" title="potente">mighty</a> man who temporarily caught me. I’ve visited the garage several times, but Bernard hasn’t been back. When he comes, I’ll follow him home, then somehow I’ll find a way to slip back into his life.
