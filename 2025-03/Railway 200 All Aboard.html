<p>Duecento anni fa, la prima locomotiva a vapore attraversò la contea di Durham, nel nord-est dell’Inghilterra, carica di undici vagoni di carbone e venti carrozze passeggeri. Un evento che segnò la nascita della ferrovia e cambiò il mondo per sempre.</p>

<p>On 27 September 1825, a <a href="##" title="a vapore">steam-powered</a> locomotive <a href="##" title="partire">set off</a> on a twenty-six mile  [41,8km] journey through County Durham, a major <a href="##" title="produttrice di carbone">coal-producing</a> region in the north-east of England. The inauguration of the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&amp;DR) was a history-making event: for the first time, a <a href="##" title="a vapore">steam-powered</a> public railway could carry products (coal) and passengers, connecting <a href="##" title="miniere di carbone">collieries</a> around Shildon with the market towns of Stockton and Darlington. Steam marked the <a href="##" title="arrivo">advent</a> of the modern railway network which spread rapidly across the country, transforming Britain’s landscape, economy and society.</p>

<h2 id="strange-structures">STRANGE STRUCTURES</h2>

<p>To celebrate the bicentennial of this important event, a year-long programme called Railway 200 is taking place across the UK. Railway 200 began on 1 January 2025 with an experience known as a ‘whistle off’, when historic locomotives across the country all sounded their <a href="##" title="fischi">whistles</a> at the same time. It continues with a broad programme of activities that reflect on the railway’s past, present and future. The innovation of steam connected Britain internally and, with <a href="##" title="a vapore">steam-powered</a> ships, to the rest of the world. Railway innovation in Britain, and railroads in the US, led to the rapid rise of the factory system and mass production, and the expansion of global commerce and <a href="##" title="affari">trade</a>. </p>

<h2 id="inspiration">INSPIRATION</h2>

<p>One of the highlights of Railway 200 is a touring exhibition train called Inspiration. Inspiration <a href="##" title="attraversare">crisscrosses</a> the British <a href="##" title="terraferma">mainland</a>, stopping at <a href="##" title="linea principale">main line</a> and <a href="##" title="storica">heritage</a> stations as well as <a href="##" title="trasporto merci">rail freigh</a>t <a href="##" title="depositi">depots</a>. It has four <a href="##" title="vagoni">carriages</a>, each with its own interactive exhibition, created not only to celebrate this year’s anniversary but to inspire young people to consider a career with the national railways.</p>

<h2 id="locomotion">LOCOMOTION</h2>

<p>As part of Railway 200, a nine-month international arts and community festival, called S&amp;DR200, <a href="##" title="rendere omaggio">pays homage</a> to historic and <a href="##" title="umile">humble</a> County Durham and to the pioneering railway line that operated there from 1825 to 1863. Held from March to November 2025, the festival includes a three-day <a href="##" title="ricostruzione, rievocazione">re-enactment</a> of the debut journey of Locomotion No. 1, which was built by celebrated railway engineers George and Robert Stephenson. Along with special exhibitions and other outdoor events, the festival also inaugurates a twenty-six-mile walking and cycling <a href="##" title="pista">trail</a> that <a href="##" title="estendersi lungo">runs along</a> much of the historical railway’s route.  </p>
