<p>Negli anni ‘50 e ‘60 la diva greco-americana trionfò in tutto il mondo con la sua straordinaria estensione vocale e le sue capacità interpretative. La sua vita ebbe però un epilogo tragico. Ne parliamo con l’autrice della sua biografia.</p>

<p>The life of American-Greek soprano Maria Callas, called “La Divina” by her legions of fans, reads like the <a href="##" title="trama">plot</a> of an opera. She was born Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropulu in New York on 2 December 1923, the daughter of Greek immigrants to the US. As a teenager, she returned to Athens, her voice already noted as unusual in its sound, versatility and expressive qualities.</p>

<h2 id="bel-canto">BEL CANTO</h2>

<p><a href="##" title="spingere">Driven</a> by <a href="##" title="risoluto">unwavering</a> <a href="##" title="impegno">commitment</a>, Callas’s career developed in Greece and then in Italy, where she performed in prestigious <a href="##" title="spazi, strutture">venues</a> such as La Scala in Milan, rising to become prima donna, the leading woman in an opera. She is credited with reviving interest in the 19th-century bel canto operas of Vincenzo Bellini (Norma), Gaetano Donizetti (Lucia di Lammermoor) and Gioachino Rossini (The Barber of Seville), and performed under internationally-renowned opera directors Luchino Visconti and Franco Zeffirelli. </p>

<h2 id="personal-life">PERSONAL LIFE</h2>

<p>In 1949, Callas married Italian industrialist Giovanni Battista Meneghini, who <a href="##" title="nominare">appointed</a> himself her manager. In 1953, she <a href="##" title="sottomettersi">underwent</a> radical weight loss, losing thirty-six kilograms. This was for health reasons and to make her more ‘<a href="##" title="idonea">suitable</a>’ for the big roles; however, she became extremely thin, and there was controversy about how she lost weight and its effect on her voice and health.</p>

<h2 id="early-death">EARLY DEATH</h2>

<p>As Callas’ international career <a href="##" title="alzarsi, sollevarsi">soared</a>, so did her reputation for temperamental behaviour. There were rumours surrounding her <a href="##" title="focose">fiery</a> personal relationships, her angry <a href="##" title="abbandoni">walkouts</a> and her rivalry with other opera stars. A 1956 article in Time magazine reported a <a href="##" title="lite">feud</a> between Callas and her mother, and in 1959 her marriage to Meneghini was annulled, and she embarked on an <a href="##" title="intermittente">on-off</a> love affair with Greek <a href="##" title="trasporto">shipping</a> <a href="##" title="magnate">tycoon</a> Aristotle Onassis. By the 1970s, Callas’ voice had deteriorated, and she gave her last performance in Paris in 1974. In 1977 she died of a heart attack at the age of fifty-three.  </p>
