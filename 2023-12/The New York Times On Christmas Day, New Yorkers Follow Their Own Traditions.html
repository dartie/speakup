<p>La città multiculturale di New York ha sviluppato una serie di usanze natalizie secolari che sono diventate parte della tradizione, come il noto albero del Rockefeller Center e i Babbo Natale dei centri commerciali.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, a Brooklyn street <a href="##" title="essere affollato">was bustling</a>. Couples carrying grocery bags ran into friends on street corners, double-parked cars lined the avenue, and one man complained that he’d been circling the block for half an hour, looking for a parking spot. But there were no Christmas <a href="##" title="canti natalizi">carols</a>, no <a href="##" title="abeti">spruce trees</a> lining the sidewalk outside <a href="##" title="gastronomie">delis</a> and <a href="##" title="nemmeno uno">nary</a> a <a href="##" title="luccicare">twinkling</a> light in sight.
In Borough Park, home to one of the largest communities of Orthodox Jews outside of Israel, it was not Christmas. It was just Tuesday.
In most of New York City, tourists and locals did what they usually do to celebrate: They attended Christmas <a href="##" title="messa">Mass</a> at St. Patrick’s Cathedral or spent the afternoon in pajamas watching A Christmas Story. (Or <a href="##" title="&quot;Trappola di cristallo&quot;">Die Hard</a>. Please <a href="##" title="discutere">argue</a> among yourselves.) But there were also other rituals to be followed: Thousands of <a href="##" title="spesso">oft</a>-disappointed but resolute New York Knicks fans <a href="##" title="farsi forza">steeled themselves</a> for the team’s almost-annual Christmas Day game, this year against the Milwaukee Bucks.
Some families <a href="##" title="affluire in gran numero">flocked</a> to homeless shelters and <a href="##" title="mense comunitarie">soup kitchens</a>, including local politicians, who <a href="##" title="indossare">donned</a> plastic <a href="##" title="grembiuli">aprons</a> and <a href="##" title="servire a cucchiaiate">spooned out</a> yellow rice and <a href="##" title="cavolo riccio">collard greens</a> at a must-stop event in Harlem. And of course, Chinese restaurants in every corner of the city were preparing for one of their busiest days of the year, when people <a href="##" title="fare la fila">stand in line</a> for hours in the cold for soup dumplings and Peking duck after a trip to the movies. There were no lines at China Glatt, Borough Park’s main Chinese restaurant. Around noon, <a href="##" title="ordinazioni">orders</a> started to <a href="##" title="arrivare">roll in</a> for chicken and broccoli with brown rice. It was a perfectly <a href="##" title="ordinario">unremarkable</a> lunch service.
A man came out of the kitchen, <a href="##" title="sorseggiare">sipping</a><a href="##" title="zuppa con le uova">egg drop soup</a>. Efraim P., who declined to give his last name because he did not have his boss’s permission, is a mashgiach, or an inspector of food in kosher restaurants. He had just finished his morning routine of <a href="##" title="selezionare">picking over</a> the restaurant’s new deliveries of potatoes, carrots and frozen french fries.
“We appreciate the American holiday, we acknowledge that it’s there, but for us life goes on,” he said.
There is meaning to be found in the mundanity of Christmas in Borough Park, said David Greenfield, a former <a href="##" title="consigliere comunale">city councilman</a> who now runs the Met Council, a Jewish charity.
“It’s intentionally a regular day so that people don’t get the <a href="##" title="impressione sbagliata">misimpression</a> that these American Jews are in fact celebrating a Christian holiday,” Greenfield said.
Depending on when you got your food, Mayor Bill de Blasio might have served you <a href="##" title="patata dolce">sweet potatoes</a>. If you came a bit later in the afternoon, <a href="##" title="senatore">Representative</a> Adriano Espaillat probably served you egg salad. Either way, chances were that Councilman Andy King of the Bronx served you <a href="##" title="cavolo riccio">collard greens</a>.
For hundreds of needy New Yorkers, their Christmas Day meal was served by a rotating cast of a dozen or so politicians.
National Action Network, founded by the Reverend Al Sharpton, has hosted a Christmas Day event for twenty-two years, and over time, it has become the <a href="##" title="il posto dove andare">go-to spot</a> for politicians looking to serve the community and get some positive <a href="##" title="faccia a faccia">face time</a> with the media.
Other politicians were later introduced before they <a href="##" title="indossare">donned</a> their <a href="##" title="grembiuli">aprons</a> and gloves to serve food. For Sharpton, their presence only reaffirmed the success of the event.
“Politicians go where people are,” he said.
