In automobile history, few names simultaneously evoke a [commitment](## "dedizione") to excellence in performance and a refined glamour as much as Ferrari does. Founded in the Italian town of Maranello, Modena, in 1939, this iconic automaker has established itself as a symbol of style and success. Over the years, Ferrari’s cars have become more than mere vehicles, they are masterpieces of engineering, artistry and [craftsmanship](## "manifattura").

## UNMISTAKABLE AESTHETICS
[Amongst](## "tra, fra") the most recognisable [traits](## "tratti") of a Ferrari is its [shade](## "gradazione") of red. This [crimson](## "cremisi")[hue](## "tonalità") is no arbitrary choice, but a tradition deeply [rooted](## "radicata") in the brand’s history. [Back in the day](## "in passato, all’epoca"), Italian racing cars were obliged to be painted red. While this rule was [lifted](## "abolire"), Ferrari chose to honour this tradition, making ‘Ferrari Red’ a pillar of the brand’s identity.
The cavallino rampante —[prancing](## "rampare") horse — logo, also an emblematic [feature](## "caratteristica"), holds a story of its own. Inspired by the legendary Italian World War One pilot Count Francesco Baracca, the black [stallion](## "stallone") on a golden backdrop [stands for](## "rappresentare") he strength, [grit](## "coraggio") and speed of the Ferrari cars. Enzo Ferrari, himself an army man, adapted this symbol from Baracca’s plane, changing the colour from red to black to fit the brand’s logo.

## NOT FOR EVERYONE 
The process of manufacturing a Ferrari is an exercise in precision and artistry. It takes approximately three weeks to make one, ensuring every detail meets the brand’s standards. For those [seeking](## "cercare") customisation, patience is a virtue, as personalised models may [take up](## "impiegare") to five years for delivery. The company’s [flagship](## "modello, marchio") model, the Ferrari 812 Superfast, has a top speed of over 211 mph and can go from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.9 seconds. 

## MORE THAN MONEY
Owning a Ferrari, however, isn’t just about having the money and the will to spend it: it’s an exclusive privilege. [Prospective](## "potenziali") buyers must meet specific criteria, either a history of prior ownership or a personal recommendation from a reputable Ferrari [dealer](## "concessionario"). Age can also be a factor, with serious consideration typically reserved for those above forty years of age.
