The life of American-Greek soprano Maria Callas, called “La Divina” by her legions of fans, reads like the [plot](## "trama") of an opera. She was born Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropulu in New York on 2 December 1923, the daughter of Greek immigrants to the US. As a teenager, she returned to Athens, her voice already noted as unusual in its sound, versatility and expressive qualities.

## BEL CANTO
[Driven](## "spingere") by [unwavering](## "risoluto") [commitment](## "impegno"), Callas’s career developed in Greece and then in Italy, where she performed in prestigious [venues](## "spazi, strutture") such as La Scala in Milan, rising to become prima donna, the leading woman in an opera. She is credited with reviving interest in the 19th-century bel canto operas of Vincenzo Bellini (Norma), Gaetano Donizetti (Lucia di Lammermoor) and Gioachino Rossini (The Barber of Seville), and performed under internationally-renowned opera directors Luchino Visconti and Franco Zeffirelli. 

## PERSONAL LIFE
In 1949, Callas married Italian industrialist Giovanni Battista Meneghini, who [appointed](## "nominare") himself her manager. In 1953, she [underwent](## "sottomettersi") radical weight loss, losing thirty-six kilograms. This was for health reasons and to make her more ‘[suitable](## "idonea")’ for the big roles; however, she became extremely thin, and there was controversy about how she lost weight and its effect on her voice and health.

## EARLY DEATH
As Callas’ international career [soared](## "alzarsi, sollevarsi"), so did her reputation for temperamental behaviour. There were rumours surrounding her [fiery](## "focose") personal relationships, her angry [walkouts](## "abbandoni") and her rivalry with other opera stars. A 1956 article in Time magazine reported a [feud](## "lite") between Callas and her mother, and in 1959 her marriage to Meneghini was annulled, and she embarked on an [on-off](## "intermittente") love affair with Greek [shipping](## "trasporto") [tycoon](## "magnate") Aristotle Onassis. By the 1970s, Callas’ voice had deteriorated, and she gave her last performance in Paris in 1974. In 1977 she died of a heart attack at the age of fifty-three.
