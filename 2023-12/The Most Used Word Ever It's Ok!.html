<p>Versatile e popolare come poche altre, questa parola —probabilmente la più usata del pianeta— non ha bisogno di traduzione. Qual è la sua origine e perché si scrive in un modo così particolare? Approfondiamo nella sua storia e nelle sue curiose ambiguità.</p>

<p>Have you ever <a href="##" title="chiedersi">wondered</a> where ‘OK’, the <a href="##" title="più usata">most widely used</a> word in the world, comes from? Many origins have been suggested, for example the Louisiana French ‘au quai’, meaning ‘to the <a href="##" title="molo">dock</a>’, said of cotton that had been approved for <a href="##" title="caricare">loading</a> on a ship, or the German ‘alles korrekt’, ‘all <a href="##" title="accurato">accurate</a>’, or even the Greek ‘olla kalla’, ‘all good’. Some argue that it evolved from ‘okeh’, a Choctaw affirmative expression in the native American tribe language. There are also theories that it was derived from the Scottish expression ‘och aye’, denoting approval.</p>

<h2 id="misspelling">MISSPELLING</h2>

<p>However, in the 1960s American linguist Allen Walker Read, an English professor at Columbia University, uncovered OK’s true origins: the expression is literally a joke dating back to 1839, when the abbreviation “o.k.” first appeared in print in a humorous article in the Boston Morning Post, next to the words “all correct”. Much like modern-day <a href="##" title="scorciatoie">shortcuts</a> such as <a href="##" title="ridere rumorosamente (laughing out loud)">LOL</a> and <a href="##" title="Oh mio Dio! (Oh my God!)">OMG</a>, an abbreviation <a href="##" title="moda">fad</a> flourished in 19th-century America and, in an attempt at humour, cultivated elites intentionally abbreviated words and <a href="##" title="sbagliare a scrivere">mis<a href="##" title="scrivere">spell</a>ed</a> them for <a href="##" title="gergo">slang</a>; so, it wasn’t strange that ‘all correct’ was abbreviated to ‘o.k.’.</p>

<h2 id="message-received">MESSAGE RECEIVED</h2>

<p>Abbreviations and mis<a href="##" title="scrivere">spell</a>ings are usually only popular for a short period of time. However, ‘OK’ <a href="##" title="rimanere">stuck around</a> thanks to the invention of the telegraph. By the 1870s it had become the standard way for early telegraph operators to <a href="##" title="riconoscere">acknowledge</a> that a message had been received.
‘OK’ soon started to appear in everyday <a href="##" title="parola">speech</a>, although it was usually only used in business contexts or in fictional dialogues to suggest that a character was uneducated.
In the 20th century, ‘OK’ was no longer considered <a href="##" title="gergo">slang</a> and had steadily <a href="##" title="farsi strada">made its way</a> into the everyday <a href="##" title="parola">speech</a> of Americans. It soon found its place in many foreign languages too. It was <a href="##" title="presumibilmente">allegedly</a> the first word spoken on the Moon when, as the <a href="##" title="veicolo d’atterraggio">lander</a> <a href="##" title="toccare terra">touched down</a>, Buzz Aldrin exclaimed: “OK, contact light”. With the <a href="##" title="apparizione">advent</a> of computers, ‘OK’ became the common label for confirming actions, and the emoji hand symbol (showing the index finger and thumb touching to make a circle) is today one of the most universally used.</p>

<h2 id="why-so-popular">WHY SO POPULAR?</h2>

<p>Whether you <a href="##" title="scrivere">spell</a> it all in <a href="##" title="maiuscolo">upper case</a> ‘OK’, or ‘O.K.’, all in lower case ‘okay’ or ‘ok’, or a combination of the two, ‘Ok’,  (even though the generally accepted form is ‘OK’, <a href="##" title="maiuscolo">upper case</a>, with no <a href="##" title="punti">full stops</a>), there is no doubt that it is the most widespread English word on the planet. But how did it conquer the world? Maybe because it’s so&hellip; useful! It’s just two letters, it’s easy for most non-English speakers to pronounce and to write, it can fill almost any <a href="##" title="vuoto, silenzio">gap</a> in conversation, it’s a verbal <a href="##" title="approvazione (pollice alzato)">thumbs-up</a> to express agreement and it’s a universally good way to say that something is alright, or not bad. Obviously, there are similar words, like ‘yes’, ‘fine’, ‘excellent’, ‘all right’, ‘satisfactory’, ‘good’ but they are <a href="##" title="dotare">endowed</a> with a stronger sense of affirmation and emotion. ‘OK’, on the other hand, is the <a href="##" title="più debole">weakest</a> form expressing agreement, <a href="##" title="in qualche modo">somehow</a> just one step above ‘no’. OK?</p>
